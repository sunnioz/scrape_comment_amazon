Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Elegant addition to the home bar,I‚Äôm a big believer in having the right glassware for the right cocktail. These glasses were the perfect addition to the home bar.
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great glasses!,I like these glasses so much I just ordered another set. So easy to hold and the weighted bottom keeps from tipping. Don‚Äôt hesitate!

S,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfectly Elegant,"I recently needed elegant glasses for an anniversary dinner and I'm really glad that I chose these sophisticated champagne glasses.Despite the fact that the glasses were inexpensive, they look really classy. The packaging was gorgeous and the glasses themselves look really well-made. I liked that they were thin but not too fragile and had a comfortable weight to them that wasn't too heavy. They were also really stable and didn't fall over easily. The tapered glasses allowed us to maintain a comfortable grip and choose whether we wanted to hold it at a wider part of the glass or a narrower one.The glasses are big enough to hold a lot of liquid. One of the reasons I chose these glasses was that the description said the tapered shape prevented drinks from losing their carbonation too quickly and I was very happy to see that that was indeed the case. I even compared it one of my older glasses with a wider shape and the difference was very noticeable. Another one of my favorite features of this set is that they are dishwasher safe, which makes cleanup easy and efficient.All in all, these glasses are exactly what I was looking for and I'm very happy with my choice. I look forward to using these more frequently because they seem to hold up really well and will definitely buy another set if I ever need more."

I love the eight 15.2-ounce double old-fashion look...and the eight sleek 11.1 ounce rocks glasses. I have purchased other store brand glasses and they are not dishwasher safe.

This Libbey Province16-piece Tumbler and Rocks Glass Set matches perfectly and complements any dinner or party. I can request a manufacture warranty by contacting the company but I opted not to because of the durability of this product.

J. Currier,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service!,"I bought this set to replace another Libbey glassware set that I bought several years ago.  That one had a pattern on the outside of the glass and was not smooth like this one.  I really like the feel of this clear, smooth glassware.  After using the glasses for a couple days I notice one of the taller glasses had a ‚Äúwobble‚Äù to it.  When sitting on our flat table it could rock back and forth 3/8‚Äù at the top.  It was enough at times to make it feel like the glass could tip over, but it never did.  I contacted Libbey to see if they could send a replacement glass, and after verifying my receipt and shipping address they sent a COMPLETE SET of 8 (16 glasses total) to replace a single glass!  Excellent customer service!  That is going above and beyond!  I‚Äôm very happy with the entire purchase and really happy with the great response to my one small problem from Libbey."

Arrived with 3 damaged- the company is sending out replacements ASAP!,"Love that the base of the glasses are FLAT, no yukky accumulation of dishwasher gook collecting on the bottom.  The taller glasses are elegant and because there is no bend/arc in the design, there is LESS chance of getting damaged in the dishwasher.  Really great too that there is 24 in a set!Really happy with my purchase.  UPDATE:  Company did not just send replacements-they sent a SET of 12 to replace 3 broken/chipped!!!

E-,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love design weight size & dimples,Beautiful design love the dimples in the sides. Good sizes although would've preferred even a larger tall glass. Especially love that these are made in the USA. I was concerned about the dimple on the bottom of the glass. I don't know why manufacturers don't make the bottoms flat so they don't hold water from the dishwasher. These do seem to dry really nicely in the dishwasher and I rarely have water puddling in the tiny dimple on the bottom. I do love the dimples on the side great for the small glass to keep by the bed and get a good grip if I want to drink at night.

Fun change from plain old glass. Concern is that the Amazon listing says dishwasher safe, but the Libby website says  ""Glass decorated or colored beverage glasses"" ""Handwash is recommended to extend decoration life"". Due to the shape of the glasses - which is much of their charm, they are difficult to hand wash and dry.  I'll survive.  They're worth it."

Pepper54,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pretty!,"These are super pretty cups! I bought them for my daughter for Christmas. They are a smidge smaller than I expected. And, they were a bit thin. Unbeknownst to me, my daughter previously had this set. She wanted a new set because she broke half of her previous ones. I thought I was getting her a completely different set than what she was used to, but she was pretty happy to open the box and see they matched what she already had. That being said, she does believe they are durable, but with most adults drinking margaritas, glasses can tend to become a little slippery. Being stemless helps, but be warned, if they are dropped at all, they will break, as opposed to the thicker styles that might not break as easily."

I did receive one with an imperfection that I almost thought was a crack, but it's within the glass. They look and feel expensive. I use them for any drink, mostly just water. They would be great for cocktails or liquor too, though. I have run them in the dishwasher multiple times and haven't had any issues. The only downside is that the taller glasses aren't very wide, so if you were to hand wash or dry them, it may be hard to fit your hand in them."

The size of these are perfect to hold and aren‚Äôt bulky and heavy, just perfect for that glass of water or juice, and the tall ones are great for a soda. They aren‚Äôt heavy duty, they are inexpensive and if I do happen to break one, I don‚Äôt feel so bad since they are a fairly inexpensive item. The glass is clear and the texture is rippled. Our whole family really loves them. I initially bought three of them at the Salvation Army just because they looked appealing, and then I had to find more so I could order my own set. So glad that they are available to purchase new. I highly recommend them."

They came quickly, and none were broken when we opened the box.  These glasses are sturdy and heavy (in a good way), while also being easy to hold!  They are great quality, and I expect they will last much longer than our previous set did!"

Henri Savin,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Large contenance, nice looks","Drinking is maybe the second important thing we can do after breathing for our survival. Why not doing it in style? I personally prefer large and transparent ones. Larges because I am a large drinker (I can drink a quart in a few seconds when really thirsty) and transparent to be able to see what I am drinking.These glasses do both very well with 8 ten Oz tumblers (what I would call whisky glass) and 8 Sixteen Oz glasses (What I would call water glass but these would work for beer too).No lead in the glass... Always a good thing though I was expecting lead to have been already forbidden in any utensils coming in contact with our mouths. It seems like Crystal glasses may still be using some, not the case here...Price seems very good: 16 glasses for less than 30$ seems a fair deal.In conclusion:I love these glasses. 5 stars."

Shawn,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,About the size of a medium can of Red Bull,"These tumbler glasses have become a household essential for me, and I'm thoroughly impressed! Great size and weight and are very durable - awesome glasses that hold a good amount of liquid.Their design is both aesthetically pleasing and remarkably durable. They look just like a medium-sized Red Bull, with a distinct can shape. In the past, I've accidentally nicked the rim of glasses against the sink while placing them in the dish rack, resulting in the breakage of our previous glassware, however, these glasses have proven to be resilient‚Äîthey haven't shown any signs of breaking or cracking despite such incidents. The set is versatile and suitable for a wide range of beverages, and its unique retro appearance adds a trendy touch. While they seem well-made, the true test of their durability will be revealed with time.Overall, a very cool and promising addition to our glassware collection perfect for our everyday dishware or in the gameroom, where these are going to live!"

Thank you lucky stars for such a good mail delivery lady!!!! These glasses were delivered with care all the way and placed gently on the porch, thank goodness! For those who don't have careful mail people.... just be glad these glasses can be returned if they arrive damaged.

While fantastic for camping or deck/outside use, we use them as our everyday wine glasses. One caveat: do NOT use scotch bright sponges or pads to clean these because they are rather soft plastic and scratch easily. Oh! And NEVER put any dairy product in them because you will never get rid of that odor. All that said, I do recommend them."

These plastic wine glasses fit the bill perfectly!Firstly, I was pleasantly surprised by how elegant and stylish they look. The clear plastic material has a high-quality, crystal-like appearance that adds a touch of sophistication to any table setting. The shape of the glass is also very flattering, with a tall stem and a wide bowl that allows the wine to breathe and fully express its flavors.But the true test came when I actually used them for the first time. I was amazed at how sturdy and stable they felt in my hand, despite being made of plastic. They didn't wobble or tip over easily, and I felt confident using them for both red and white wines. The material also seems to insulate the wine, keeping it at the perfect temperature for longer.Cleaning them was a breeze too! I simply rinsed them with warm water and soap, and they came out looking just as shiny and new as when I first opened the package. I've used them several times now and they still look and feel as good as new.Overall, I highly recommend these plastic wine glasses to anyone looking for a durable, stylish and convenient alternative to traditional glassware. They're perfect for outdoor gatherings, picnics, or even for daily use in your home. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying more in the future!"

C. Simpson,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Better Than Expected,Due to reviews I read I was expecting to have some issues with these glasses. There were no issues. Every glass was perfect. The rims are not sharp. They stack so well even after using and washing. They are not dishwasher safe. I recommend these glasses.
Susan A. Lamoureux,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb,"Five stars all around - we don't ""gift"" them so I can form an opinion here.  We have used these for three of our last parties.  They are fantastic.  I love that they are eco-friendly and recyclable."

VA,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a party,This is great when you want to have an occasion without dishes. You can throw away but if you wanted to wash they could be used many times. Not really a gift item unless it‚Äôs for someone who hosts frequent parties. They were great for my purposes and I felt bad to throw away because they were nice. It‚Äôs nice to enjoy events with your guests and not dreading dishes afterwards. Also a huge upgrade to the outdoor red solo cups in the summer!
Jenee S,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome wine ""glasses""","I am about to buy another package of these. As someone who breaks glasses all the time, I wanted something that wasn't embarrassingly cheap but that wouldn't break on my tile floors. (I know, try drinking less wine ha ha) I got a few kinds to try out- these were the best. You have to hand wash them but they do not get cloudy at all I've reused some of them for two years and you can't tell the difference. The only reason I need more is because I've sent them home with my neighbors and I've lost a few to boiling water (don't strain your spaghetti in the sink with one in there!) They are really very,very good-especially for the low cost. No complaints at all!"
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap, Cute and disposable",These were perfect for a Christmas party I had. They are plastic so I didn't have to worry about someone dropping and breaking a glass. I customized them with names and some of the girls wanted to keep their cups as they are reusable. I think these cups are only useful for parties as I would never gift them to someone as an actual real gift.

Brozone,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect plastic cups that look like glass.,"These are my go to cups for any drink by the pool. They look like real glass. When I have used them at my condo in Puerto Vallarta security and other guest will come over and tell me no glass allowed in the pool area. When I explain to them I know! It‚Äôs plastic, they are amazed and want to know more about them. Skip the cheap disposable red cups and use these for your next outdoor gathering or party. Makes everything look more sophisticated. Plus they are inexpensive enough to throw away if you lose them or don‚Äôt want to reuse them. The ladies love drinking their ros√© out of them. The bros can look refined drinking vodka tonics."

Collette Vaughan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2022",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great reusable option,I was doubtful about this cup as we swear by the Govina brand. For a dollar a cup it‚Äôs a great investment for reusable cups over and over and over again. Ours have already gone through three parties and lots of deck entertaining. Broken glass during a party is a total buzz kill !! It is a bummer that they have to be hand washed but a small investment of time to not have to throw a bunch of plastic in the landfill.  We use expo dry erase markers to put peoples names on cups and make sure we tell everybody not to put them in the trash or recycle them. I think we‚Äôve only lost one so far. We‚Äôve even lent the set to friends!

They click together which makes them super easy to travel with, and because they're plastic, I don't have to worry about taking them to the pool or out and about. If I happen to lose one, it isn't the end of the world because they are so inexpensive. You wouldn't want to host a fancy dinner with these, but a cookout or picnic on the beach and these are absolutely the right choice.Super happy with this product and highly recommend, especially for someone looking for an alternative to glass."

I thought they would look great on the shelf and as a drink in hand. The blue staining is extremely well done and has the perfect opacity. The ribbed design while looking great, adds grip to the glass which is helpful when the outside of the glass gets wet from condensation. Overall this is a great set of glassware that I highly recommend."
Candice C,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice, heavy glasses","The first thing I noticed was that these glasses are heavyyyy! They feel nice and sturdy in your hand, both in weight and with the raised retro detailing. They arrived well-packaged so you can set your mind at ease if you're sending them as a gift, although weighing 12 oz each, these feel like they can take a tumble. The rose gold is more gold instead of rose, so they're not super feminine and only reserved for girls' night in. These beautiful glasses will not disappoint. There's one negative but it's tiny. They're handwash only, but it is a small price to pay given that real colored glass is going to set you back way more than this."
Samantha,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful,These are beautiful glasses. They have a great weight to them and are a great size for tea or cocktails.
Oculus27,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Elegant lowball glass drinkware,"I love the way they were packaged with good cardboard compartments for each glass made it easy to unbox and zero damage from long-distance shipping.The ribbed and pattern design of the glassware looks upscale without the hefty price compared to fine department store sales.The blue color is so nice and the short glass is great for liquor but I tend to use these glasses for juices and water.It is a short glass so it is only sometimes a great choice for drinking during a meal or when active as it will not hold enough to quench that thirst. Plus very easy to clean even though hand washing is highly recommended the short stature of the glasses takes minimal effort to clean.Overall, the glassware is a nice addition to your drinkware. The price point is extremely affordable and there are other color choices offered by the seller."
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful Glasses,"These glasses are elegant and on trend.  Elevate a simple glass of juice or use for cocktails.  The blue is a deeo rich colour and looks great  no matter what you fill them with.  I am in love with them, my new favourite glass to use."
Chandelle,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Gorgeous and excellent quality,"I have been eye balling other brands of this style for a year now...I was so excited to see these in the Ocean blue color I wanted. They are a gorgeous set! Well made, thicker, but perfect to hold, and not too heavy. They are very pretty, the blue is almost turquoise when it's unpacked and ready for use. Could not be happier! They wash well, and look great on a full table setting. I'm super happy about these. Used them over the holidays, and looking forward to summer use as well!"
Amy B,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful and Heavy,"Okay these are seriously the best glasses. I was nervous that one might arrive broken since I have never had glass shipped to me before, but they arrived super securely and all in one piece, but that is the smallest part of the 5 starts, when I tell you that these glasses are BEAUTIFUL - like absolutely stunning. I saw that someone else had reviewed that you could see the seem marks, however I looked through all of mine and could not find any. So not only are the beautiful to look at, but they are super heavy and feel like expensive glassware. Such a gem of a find and will be perfect for hosting future diner parties!"

Xander,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful glasses,"This set of glasses are beautiful and seem very heavy duty, yet classy. They are very thick making them heavy and sturdy, but the ribbed design makes them easy to hold on too even if your cold drink produces condensation and makes the glass wet. These make great cocktail glasses (that's mostly what I've used them for) but would be nice for any beverage. The ribbed design also gives them a classic retro vibe, which I love. I can find nothing negative to say about them, I love them!"

The textured design is pleasantly tactile, the weight feels substantial but not heavy, and the design has a retro aesthetic that we both liked. Another reviewer mentioned visible seams, and I did not notice them but neither did I inspect each glass with sincere scrutiny. Definitely happy with them and looking forward to serving others with them."

They are sturdy/thick enough to be a daily drinking glass, or on special occasions. I ordered the rose gold glasses and they are a golden pink - exactly what I was looking for. The directions say hand wash only, so that's the only drawback I can see. Otherwise, particularly for the price, these are lovely and would also make a great gift. Definitely recommend!"

I am extremely happy with this and would recommend.

They add a special effect to a basic cocktail and look great on the table. They are made of very thick glass and are quite heavy, but still feel good in the hand. They appear quite sturdy and will probably last for a long time. The design is pretty and goes well with other vintage style glassware that I have. They not only work as whiskey or cocktail glass, but are also fun to use for simply water or juice. They would make a great gift too."
Anonymous ,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hefty, attractive glasses that look high end",These are quality drinking glasses that look great whether they are used for drinks or holding your favorite makeup brushes. Their embossed pattern is just complex enough to make for an attractive contrast when mixed with simpler glassware. I use mine alongside hobnail highballs and the two complementary patterns look like they were made for each other.
Jillian M.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite glasses,"I adore these. They are good and solid/thick and sturdy, and the beading makes them satisfying to both hold and drink out of. The pattern is very visually appealing.

I like them even more than the pictures, and they have become my favorite glasses."

B Wallis,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,I love a good coupe- delicate but beautiful!,"Champagne flutes are so boring. These coupes bring back the classic feel for a good champagne toast, esp. if you are drinking a good one. Sized generously so you can enjoy the aroma and deliciousness even before your first sip. Obviously your champagne will lose its carbonation sooner in a coupe vs. a flute but girl, you should be drinking it, not photographing that!!And there is nothing more stunning than a champagne coupe tower at a wedding or special celebration. These are a little delicate but I think they'll hold up just fine with handwashing and care."
Elle B.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect coupe glasses,"I had been looking for coupe glasses locally for some time without success. At the current price of $5 per glass, these are very affordable for the quality.These glasses are the perfect cross between being fragile and dainty, yet still comfortable enough to use in an outdoor setting. These glasses are lightweight and certainly not designed for being banged down on counters or bumped. However, they are not so thin that I worry about chipping them by setting them down on a stone table or toasting. One thing that I will mention, is that these are dishwasher safe, but I would use caution when dishwashing them. Because they are so light, they are prone to moving around in the water spray and could easily break. I always hand wash mine and have found them to be very easy to clean. If you have a gentle dishwasher, this may be no issue, but I would probably still suggest putting them only on the top rack.Overall, these glasses look phenomenal and I would recommend them to anyone. They are perfect for everything from a Manhattan to a martini and a mojito. These add a touch of class to any gathering and the price is right."

Shana,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Great retro glasses; surprisingly sturdy,"I love these old-school glasses. They're much more like older (1920s) champagne glasses than margarita or daiquiri glasses, IMO (they don't hold much), but they're gorgeous and excellent for champagne cocktails, lemon twists, etc. I don't do alcohol, but I feel very fancy drinking sparkling cider out of them, and my husband likes them for prosecco. I love to make a special cocktail for guests, so I can't wait to be able to have people over again and serve something fun in these retro glasses. They are pretty sturdy...my dog pulled the box off of the foyer table and onto the floor before I had a chance to open it (he thinks all packages are Bark Boxes üòÅ), and there was no cushioning in the box, so I expected them to be broken or at least chipped, but they were still flawless. They're not the highest quality crystal, but they look and feel good, and I'll take sturdy for 98% of applications when it comes to glassware.I would definitely recommend these, and I plan to order at least one more set."

They are a fairly decent size, not too thin, and arrived in nice condition without any cracks or scratches. While you can feel the seam fairly easily along the stem of the glass, it still feels fairly sturdy otherwise and it doesn‚Äôt take away from handling any. There isn‚Äôt a divot in the base of the glass where the stem ends and the bowl begins, since it‚Äôs a pressed glass, which makes it fairly easy to clean.Overall, a very decent, standard set of coupe glasses for any martinis or other beverages you intend to serve in them!"
Bhatta's Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,Classic cocktail glasses!,"These are fairly thick classic cocktail glasses. These aren't super thick or heavy but just basic cocktail glasses which can be used for drinking two parts whiskey, one part sweet vermouth Manhattans, Lime juice daiquiris, margaritas and much more. The classic shape and size makes it very versatile cocktail glasses to have around at home for self and for entertaining your guests.The only issue I found is that somehow Amazon decided to ship this in a plastic envelope bag rather than a box.. I was worried that the contents would be broken in transit but looks that the manufacture packaging inside was luckily adequate enough for surviving the harsh environment of transportation and shipment. If the seller is reading this review it is advisable to instruct Amazon to ship this in a box rather than mere plastic envelope for shipment.Minor quibble as described above but since that is not product related I am not considering that a negative for the overall star rating. For the asking price the item is nice and worthy of five stars!"

When you live in humid country where your glass sweats all the time it is great to have one that doesn't because they are insulate.  On my set I had one that lost it's seal and the company replaced it.  I even purchased lids for our so you can use them outside and keep the bugs out of your glass.  It's a win-win in my opinion!

Bruce E Bennett,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024",5.0 out of 5 stars,Is the glass half full (drink) or half empty (air)?,"I really like these cups.They were heavier than I figured, which I consider a bonus as more stable when drink especially almost empty of beverage & a strong breeze picks up when outside.  Tried to find something to complain about, but really can't. Maybe if you're cheap - I mean thrifty - I mean economical - as myself we can lament the high cost. But then pretty much everything costs too much, especially if quality, longevity, etc is factored into the total cost. That is, the initial purchase price surely ain't no where near the total product cost or other impact."

Thousands of miles and trips up and down the states and over to the west and they were still in good condition. After some 15 to 20 years of use we gave them to a friend. We decided to get colored ones since we are now in a home. Love the colors Blue and Green. I just wish we could get the 12 oz mugs in the same color. I guess we could buy one at time but the cost is prohibitive. Be a great move to have these mugs in a 4 pack one color like the 16oz. Great product second too non.

Highly recommended.
utente,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2021",5.0 out of 5 stars,"beautiful, like more expensive crystal","I have their wine glasses, so I figured that these would also be good.  I would have bought glasses that were shorter and wider. I was concerned that these would be more difficult to drink from, requiring me to bend my head back to far especially when the glass is almost empty.  But...my wife insisted on these tall glasses.As usual, she won.  In theory, my concerns were justified.  In practice, pretty much irrelevant.  The glasses look good, as clear as more expensive crystal.  At the price, I'm less concerned about breaking.So, the glasses are really high quality, especially for the price.  I'd gladly buy more from the manufacturer if we had room in the kitchen."

I did receive one with an imperfection that I almost thought was a crack, but it's within the glass. They look and feel expensive. I use them for any drink, mostly just water. They would be great for cocktails or liquor too, though. I have run them in the dishwasher multiple times and haven't had any issues. The only downside is that the taller glasses aren't very wide, so if you were to hand wash or dry them, it may be hard to fit your hand in them."

Pepper54,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2023",5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pretty!,"These are super pretty cups! I bought them for my daughter for Christmas. They are a smidge smaller than I expected. And, they were a bit thin. Unbeknownst to me, my daughter previously had this set. She wanted a new set because she broke half of her previous ones. I thought I was getting her a completely different set than what she was used to, but she was pretty happy to open the box and see they matched what she already had. That being said, she does believe they are durable, but with most adults drinking margaritas, glasses can tend to become a little slippery. Being stemless helps, but be warned, if they are dropped at all, they will break, as opposed to the thicker styles that might not break as easily."

Wol ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,"For the price, they‚Äôre ok.",They‚Äôre as basic as 20 dollar discount glasses from the 90s go. They have a weird tint to them that makes them cast brown-ish but they haven‚Äôt shattered or anything weird. No seams but the rolled edge does have defects on about 25% of the glasses. Nothing noticeable to a guest drinking water but these aren‚Äôt going to be the best glass cocktail glasses either.

Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Low quality, lack of quality control, actually made by Crisa","Edit/update: so I've had these for a while now, and I have to admit that despite their defects, they're kindof growing on me. I still like their design, and the thickness of the glasses is good. I just wish their quality was better. Libbey did send me free replacements which was nice, but the replacements still had problems. They were better than the original ones I had overall, but not by like a ton. They still had some problems. Despite that, I have to admit that having had them for a while, I kinda like them despite their imperfections. I just wish so much that they were higher quality because I love the design. It's a real shame. Libbey has this one major flaw which is some kind of problem with quality, either with quality control or manufacturing, I'm not sure. Their designs are great, but the quality on them is just not great.Despite that, I'm finding that I do like these glasses.So, if you can live with lots of small imperfections, I think these are actually great glasses. You just have to live with imperfections, which sucks, but oh well. Libbey's customer service is good, but I honestly would have prefered if they'd just fixed their problem with quality and manufacturing rather than sending me free glasses. The free glasses were nice, but I just wish they would get their act together on quality because their products are actually great. Anyway, I like these glasses despite their flaws, and I think you'll find much the same experience if you can stand the small imperfections.Original review:I bought these because I was expected high quality glasses. I had read the other reviews, and was mostly concerned about broken glasses. What I should have been more concerned about was the reports of low quality. Just one of these problems in and of itself wouldn't be so bad, but there are a lot of problems that affect almost every glass:Every single glass has a tilted base/bottom inside the glass. The tilts are all different, some aren't so bad, a few are very noticeable. One of the short glasses doesn't even have a flat base at the very bottom of the glass. One of the tall glasses leans to one side, like it's slouching. All of the glasses have small bubbles and other imperfections on them. The tall glasses all have noticeable seams running down their sides, some of the short glasses do as well. Some of the glasses have small dents and other impressions. The tops of the glasses are not very level, though this is fairly minor. One of the glasses has a black spot in the glass on the outside, no clue what it is or why it's there, seems to be part of the glass or something. Every glass has a scar-like seam at the bottom, looks like a cut that's been stitched. There are lots of points where it looks like the glass has been slightly pinched or something during manufacture.I dishwashed all of these glasses, mind you. They seem sturdy, and if it weren't for these imperfections, this would be a fine glass set. But there are just so many imperfections. The lack of a flat base inside the glass makes every glass just look off. They just look kinda poorly made.I'm dubious about returning them. If I exchange them for more of the same, I'm afraid I'll just end up with the same problems. If I buy other glasses, who is to say if they'll be any better? I was hoping that by buying Libbey, I'd be buying some high quality glasses, but that isn't the case.These don't even have the Libbey L on the bottom. They say Crisa on the bottom because apparently Libbey owns Crisa. So although these claim to be Libbey glasses, they're actually Crisa glasses manufactured by Crisa which Libbey owns. I originally also ordered some heavy base glasses from Libbey, but cancelled those after looking at the low quality of these.If you're looking for cheap glasses and don't really care what they look like, then I guess these will do. But if you're looking for high quality glasses, buy something else. These are low quality."

I suspect it was from the dishwasher, but I can't be sure.  I know that glassware does suffer from attrition.  That said, the glasses are nothing spectacular, but useful.  All are bottom weighted, which is good, but the sides are straight, so be careful with wet or greasy hands, because they might slip on you."

Pen Name,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Basic and inexpensive high and lowball glasses,"These clean and clear tumblers come with no frills and no promises.  They may be thinner than some other brands, but then, they are amongst the lowest priced sets offered on Amazon.  So while some reviews are crabby about ""easily broken"" the product is indeed made of glass and will succumb to intentional or unintentional trauma.  I like the simple yet elegant look of these glasses and appreciate the balance of the heavier bottom.  They are a good value, arrived well packaged to protect from breakage during shipment, and are a good choice for everyday drinking glasses.

Joe,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Dishwasher issue,"The base of this drinkware has a very deep depression which leaves a lot of water after being cleaned in my dishwasher.  Glassware manufacturers  need to join the 21st century, realize new dishwashers use low heat drying, a half inch deep well on the glass base when inverted in the dishwasher will leave a pool of water. Need to really angle the glass to allow for draining. My new Bosch dishwasher racks struggle drying this drinkware.Other than this issue, I like this item.

Sally C.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful but too delicate,"I hesitated to buy these because some people said they break easy and some people said they were durable.  I'm finding that for my home, they aren't that durable.  I bought these and also the goblets and a number of them have broken already and are in the trash, at least a half of a dozen.  One little tap and that's all it seems to take to crack them.  I wash by hand, though.  I don't have a dishwasher.  Might be different if you weren't washing yourself."

Halsteads,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fun and nice glasses,"I really like the swirl of blue on these glasses but the only thing I have not liked is that they seem to break a bit easier than the previous glasses that I bought which are unrelated to these other than they are cups. For those of you who have read Brandon Sanderson secret project number one I do not collect cups. Regardless, I really like these and bought a second set just because we've broken several at this point but I would call it a good value even having them break. So far we've lost maybe four?"

Doubt that's from shipping.  I love the dimples in the sides making it easy to hold.  I'm just going to keep the glasses because it's a 40 mile trip for me to return them.  I'll just have that glass in the back of the cupboard and use it myself if needed. I'd give it 5 if it wasn't for the chip.

They‚Äôre like a relative you absolutely adore until you spend a little too much time together. They will occasionally break in the dishwasher if not placed carefully. They‚Äôre not the best choice for clumsy kiddos. But they look pretty on the table so I bought a backup set on sale. We‚Äôll enjoy these until I break em all or find something I like as much.

The divots in the side are so fun and great for holding the glass. However, their difficulty lies and getting them clean in the dishwasher.

The only drawback so far, is the dent or 'valley' in the bottom of the glasses.  When these are washed in the dishwasher, even on the crystal dry setting, a pool of water forms at the top (bottom) of each glass, so they aren't completely dry.  I take a dry towel and do a quick puddle pick up, before emptying the dishwasher.If these could be made with just a flat bottom, I would give these 5 stars, for sure!"

We now make sure these do not rattle around and click on other dishware, and better yet we hand wash these glasses. The thin rim and heavy base is actually a nice feature, but makes the glass fragile. You will find some that are not round but oval shaped at the top. There are indentations for your fingers on the sides that were formed when the glass was hot. You will like these and get compliments on them, just be careful and hand wash to care for them."

But, I think it was a factory defect or something like that, because the rest have held up fine, despite less careful handling. I've been using them for at least a couple months now and I like them a lot. They're bottom-heavy; I end up holding them with my thumb in one divet, one of my fingers in the opposite divet, and then my pinkie supporting the bottom. I like that the top of the glass is thin; it's a better drinking experience. And they're gorgeous.

I am mostly pleased and happy with the glasses, but not 100%.(1) I am extremely happy with the timing. The glasses were originally supposed to get to me on March 4th, but they arrived on March 2nd.(2) I am extremely happy with the packaging of the 8 goblets. I was actually very worried that they'd be packaged in a flimsy box. I am very happy that I was incorrect in that they were packaged very securely. The only way these would have been damaged is if someone dropped them.(3) I am mediocre happy because I had expected them to be slightly larger in the opening. The opening is definitely not 3.1 inches. They are quaint though and very pretty.(4) I am most definitely NOT happy with the Quality Assurance team. One of the glasses base is uneven. As you set the glass down, it wobbles from side to side. This is a workmanship/manufacture/glasscreation process error and an issue that the Libbey QA team should have caught. Turning the glass over, bottoms up, the surface looks like a twisted frisbee.(5) I am EXTREMELY happy with Libbey's Customer Care team. I contacted LIbbey (the package comes with information on how to contact Libbey if you are unsatisfied with their product and information on how to care for the glasses) and they were able to quickly rectify the issue with with wobbly glass.With the experience of this purchase, I would definitely order from Libbey again. =)"

Bluzeman,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not diswasher safe,"**Edit**  I contacted Libbey and they sent me a whole new set.  5 stars for customer service.  I still gave 4 because the 2 shouldn't have broken in the dishwasher but as the rep said, it may have been a bad batch.  Nice glasses, excellent customer services.I really liked these glasses.  However, 2 of the tall ones just broke in the dishwasher so they must be made of very cheap glass.  And since there is no way to purchase replacements, I no longer have a full set.  Guess I'll give the remaining ones to Goodwill and buy something better."

KansasKim,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice glasses, mind the indentions","I love the colors. Just cough the surprised that the bottom part of the glass has finger indentions, I guess to hold the glass more secure? Not sure why. I think it offers no real function and makes a whimsical glass look warped."
Chevra,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Looks nice,"These are really pretty and mostly easy to hold. When the glass sweats though, be careful. The glass is pretty thin and seems like it could break easily, though we haven't broken one yet! Good product overall and I'm happy we bought them."

Tammy Dee Walsh,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,A little smaller than expected but still keepers,They feel nice in your hand and look nice.

Susan Kaminski,"Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2019",4.0 out of 5 stars,That they are exactly as advertised.,"Love these glasses.

Kevin Hudak,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Flaw, but easily/quickly replaced","One of the glasses had a flaw.  The return/replacement process was to contact Libbey Glass directly, not Amazon.  Libbey sent a new box of glasses, and we didn't have to return the original package.

Veste Mocoso,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great glasses but break easily,"We bought a set of 8 glasses 5 months ago and we loved them, they were the perfect size and shape, and they lasted exactly 5 months.

Donna Marie,"Reviewed in the United States on June 24, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Glasses are attractive/customer service is excellent,I like the weight size and look of these glasses and use them for serving water. After 60 days of use I noticed a chip on the top of one glass. The were guaranteed for 30 days but I sent a text to Libby asking if they could sent me one glass as Amazon only sells them in packs of 8. Libby responded immediately with an offer that went beyond my expectations and I received 8 glasses the very nextday.

razor edge,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Of eight glasses, only one arrived cracked upon delivery","Was hesitant to purchase glassware online but the price seemed decent. The glasses arrived packed in a rigid carton with seemingly adequate support; seven were in pristine condition and only one had a single crack that rendered it unusable. I had expected a worse breakage ratio, so with one loss, these were still cheaper than the local retailer. Quality seems comparable to basic generic glassware you could pick up anywhere. Just go for it if you don't mind discarding one, because you'll likely still save money."

HK,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty and heavy,"I really like these. I wanted a certain size to fit in my fridge‚Äôs water dispenser. The etched design is nice and gives it some grip. They are a bit heavier than my other Libby glasses, but that‚Äôs no issue. Somehow though, one is already chipped at the rim (less than a week), and we had to toss it. These were packaged really well, and I didn‚Äôt notice a chip while unpacking them, and it wasn‚Äôt dropped or knocked (three adults in house, no kids), so not sure how it happened, so I am questioning how durable they will be."

Jan,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Rather light weight, but attractive","I was looking to replace nice heavy weight commercial style glasses (Libbey Inverness, 14 oz) with something of a similar weight and heft.  These glasses are attractive and do have a weighted bottom, but the thickness of the walls of the glass were not comparable.  The weight (not capacity) of my old beverage glasses is 18.52 oz each, these glasses weigh 11.85 oz each (there is also a 6 oz capacity difference, these being an 8 oz capacity).  I would think for most users these glasses would be very acceptable, and they are quite attractive, but having been in the foodservice industry for several decades, I wanted something with much heavier weight (and assumed durability) than these seem to offer.  I will most likely return these and try the Libby Optiva 14 oz which look to be a heavier weight."

We used to have a similar set of glasses without the carvings and were difficult to hold. So, tried these and as expected the design provides extra grip.Immediately after opening the pack we checked to make sure everything is fine. Then put them in dishwasher to be safe. We observed that one of the glasses is broken after the wash. Not sure whether it is because of the hot water setting on the dishwasher [Check the picture]. All the other items are fine.

Frequent Purchaser,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Just plain fun!,"Recently, I started harvesting wild prickly pear cactus fruit, and making prickly pear margaritas for my wife and me.  We didn't have proper glasses though, until I spotted these.

They look great and my wife enjoys the drinks even more.  Exceeds my expectations for fun and enjoyment.  See below.Most people start out reviews from one of two positions.  About 5% of all reviews are a one star because the product they received was poor quality, or they did not get it all and the consumer is just mad.  I don‚Äôt believe 5% of every product made goes out useless, but everyone who gets a bad unit will tell you.About 90% of reviewers start at 5 stars, and if the reviewer did not find anything heinous about the product, that‚Äôs what they give.  To 90% of people, 5 stars means, ‚Äúit was just ok.‚ÄùFrom this day forward, my reviews start from the middle.  Three stars: the product met my expectations.  If I give it four stars, the product exceeded my expectations for quality, value, or performance. In case of five stars, the got itself out of the box itself and walked across the water.If I give a product two stars, it failed to meet my expectations in some way.  Anything deserving the ignominious one star review either went back to the vendor or in the dumpster."
Island Mermaid,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful, but sooo small!","I giggled out loud when I opened the box. It‚Äôs on me, I should‚Äôve paid attention to the dimensions, but I just never dreamed margarita glasses would be so short & tiny! So, these diminutive, 4-inch (only 4-inch!) glasses were quite a surprise, & actually, an adorable & amusing sight! The only bummer: I need way bigger margarita glasses than this! These don‚Äôt hold much liquid at all in the first place, & if you add ice, it‚Äôll be that much less. So unfortunately, they‚Äôre not completely practical for me; that said, however, I still might keep them! Why? Because 1) they have a beautiful, modern design, 2) they are a pleasure to hold, as the small, smooth base fits nicely in your hand, & 3) their small size really does make them adorable, & I think they‚Äôd charm everyone & give them a chuckle. So, I do still recommend them, as long as you are aware of the dimensions & are okay with very small margarita glasses. Maybe you would put a whole pitcher on the table, & then just keep refilling the glasses? I hope the manufacturer will eventually make & offer a larger size in this same design, though, as I do love every single thing about them except for their size."

Tritium,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap but not the most sturdy,"Our first order of these glasses arrived with one having a chipped base. There were not any glass shards or pieces in the box, so this chip would have happened prior to boxing. Not happy about that.Even with our second order, I noticed that these do not feel very sturdy. Setting them down after a sip, it sounds like they could chip/break easily at any moment. They also have fairly noticeable casting seams on opposing sides.Either way, they're cheap and hold margaritas fine."

Raphael,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2017",4.0 out of 5 stars,But the glasses themselves are beautiful and look very solid,"Well, for anyone worried about glass breaking in transit, even though this was FBA, the seller had the individual glasses wrapped with so much bubble wrap in a separate box, they were invincible.  The only negative about that is there is no original box as you would find in stores, which is a minor issue if you intended to give them as a gift as I do.  Also no way of knowing if they are new or, in fact, Libbey glass even.  But the glasses themselves are beautiful and look very solid, so it‚Äôs a trade off.  I think the recipient will love them regardless, so really just a small issue on my part."

They are very similar, but 1.3 oz heavier.  The bottoms are thicker, but they hold 16 oz. and will work just fine.  I don't think my guests will notice.  I never had the 8 oz. glasses, but I put my 8 oz glasses in a give-a-way box and replaced them with these.

Ashley watcher,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like them so far.,"So I read all the 1 star reviews and decided to do a really good look over on these before I kept them.Not a single one was broken, not a single one is purple, and not a single one has cracks or chips.They did come dirty, but that‚Äôs okay because there is a paper in the box that states they are shipped directly from the manufacturer and that they need to be washed. It‚Äôs cardboard powder and it came off with a rise.The base is thick and sturdy, while it does thin out a lot towards the top, so if you don‚Äôt like thin glass this isn‚Äôt for you.These are gentle glasses, but in my opinion all glass should be cared for gently. Otherwise I recommend getting plastic or acrylic.Also it‚Äôs glass it‚Äôs not 100 percent perfect. It will be as close as possible to perfect, but there are chances it will have slight bubbles, bumps, and even be a tiny bit taller or shorter.These specific glasses I received are all practically identical.We will see how they handle in a dish washer although I‚Äôm more of a wash by hand person."

A consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,"These are well made. But, the large size and flared shape are a bit too wide for the dishwasher rack. Also, the flared angles cause them to tip into and bump into each other on the shelf, rather than slide easily when pushed together, when arranging them on the shelf or reaching around them. I would buy a different shape next time, a straight cylindrical styled (boring) type tumbler."

Most of them were perfect, one had glass threads inside, which snapped off but then there‚Äôs still a little sharp spot on the bottom. So that one holds my paintbrushes, no big deal to me. The weight really is nice, these are very stable, heavy enough it can safely hold my larger long handled brush painting brushes, but not so heavy that it feels clunky or is unpleasant to use."
A consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,"These are well made. But, the large size and flared shape are a bit too wide for the dishwasher rack. Also, the flared angles cause them to tip into and bump into each other on the shelf, rather than slide easily when pushed together, when arranging them on the shelf or reaching around them. I would buy a different shape next time, a straight cylindrical styled (boring) type tumbler."

I do like the glasses although they tend to sweat a lot and definitely require some sort of coaster.

Derb,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for people who are anal/OCD, but cheap & serviceable","The glasses feel sturdy and were packaged well. However, there‚Äôs so much variation in the shape of them that it‚Äôs kind of comical. Hard to tell from the pic because of the glare, but each glass is slightly different in overall height, slope of side wall, thickness & slope of base, and thickness of rim. Sometimes this is a plus/feature for handmade glass, but these are definitely machined. So if it is important to you for your glassware to be matchy-matchy, or if you are a person who is bothered by small imperfections, I would not get these.Also, the first set I received had a small but noticeable bulge/drip on many of the rims which I didn‚Äôt like, but they immediately shipped me a new set when I requested a return, so I was at least impressed by the customer service."

Overall, after owning these several years, I have NOT broke another glass, but I will be donating these due to the fact that I probably haven‚Äôt broken these because I am afraid to use them unless I have guests over. They are in fact very thin as other reviewers mention. I find that I am reaching for a tumbler, or water bottle over these on a regular basis and decided to invest in a stronger glass that doesn‚Äôt scare me to use it."

I am always pleased with the quality of Libby's products.  they harken back to when things were made to stand up to normal life and last a long time.When I buy Ikea glasses, I know they'll all be broken in a year.  So that's why I chose to go with Libby.  We still have libby glasses that my Grandmother purchased in the 50's.  They stand up  to dishwashers, kids  pets and tired parents. Price was attractive, as well.  Really,  hey had it all going on,  loved the look and feel of them, but as an occasional fumbler of drinking glasses, and sometimes distracted, though these might spell trouble.

William Faulk,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,It makes my drinks colder.,"These cups successfully make my drinks colder. It can bring a full 16oz of room temperature soda to refrigerator temperatures in just a few minutes. It can bring a second filling down to very close to refrigerator temperature, too, if you're fast enough.The one actual problem I have is that the inside of the cups are so narrow that there is absolutely no way to clean them without a bottle brush. So make sure you have one, or just go ahead and order one at the same time.I do have a few nitpicks: It feels to me that there's too little freezing gel in these cups. As I said, it successfully makes my drinks cold, so I don't know what I'm complaining about, but it's seriously only like 60% full. It seems like they'd work even better if they were more full. The instructions say to freeze them upside down, but that's not really feasible in my freezer for space reasons. But freezing them on their side doesn't seem to cause any problems. They sometimes make cracking noises, like ice cracking. But I never see any cracks form in the frozen gel. I'm worried that it's cracking the plastic shell. (They seem to do this no matter the orientation they were frozen in.)"

Mark Twain,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Not full of gel,"This tumbler works ok.  However, at room temperature the wall cavity is only 1/3 full of gel, up to the lower edge of the silicone band. See the photo of a dry, empty cup. Just out of the freezer, it‚Äôs up to the higher edge of the band. So, it doesn‚Äôt chill the top third and it has the the unusual appearance of gel droplets that don‚Äôt go away.  Maybe the manufacturers don‚Äôt fill it with more gel to account for more expansion in the case someone puts it in a super cold freezer.  Maybe it would be a hazard to have frozen gel at the rim, where it touches your lips, but the frozen gel level stops well short of that in regular usage. Whatever the reason, the gel droplets are not aesthetic, but the bottom half does help keep the contents cold and the silicone does not get wet or slippery in your hand."
C. Winton,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice looking, but not as comfortable to hold as I would like","I bought a set of these for drinking beer and have been using them regularly for about a month. They are definitely attractive and hold a full pint. A 12 oz pour generates enough of a head to fill to the top with most beers. I store mine upright in the freezer so they are always ready for use. I haven't tried freezing them upside down yet, but plan to do so to see how that works. The black band is supposed to make them more comfortable to hold, and it does tend to insulate a little so you don't numb your hand so much.  That being said, I don't find them to be as comfortable to hold as the set of double wall glass beer glasses I also use. I think the difference is the size and texture of the grip area."

JD,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,I wish we could give half or partial 'stars',"I rated these a 4, but for me they are really more like 3.5-3.75.Nothing wrong per se it just comes down to wishing there was a little more freezer gel in the cups.The first one I put in the freezer, I did upside down so debris didnt get IN the cup while it was there, not thinking of the gel note being able to expand when frozen.  Therefore the full bottom 2-3inches of the cup had no frozen gel, and therefore no cooling in what I will assume is the most important place... the bottom of the cup where the oldest beer will be sitting just warming up. :(The second try I froze the cup right side up.  This worked better because now the bottom of the cup had a thick cold frozen gel in it... however, that left the cooling capability at the top of the cup lacking.  The amount of gel in these cups when frozen stops somewhere under the silicon band.  Leaving maybe 3inches at the top of the cup empty of frozen cooling gel.Therefore the frozen gel is only directly cooling maybe 7-9 ounces of your 12oz beer. Maybe not a horrible issue since its the top, and those 3-5 ounces will be the first consumed and therefore the top beer level will drop into the cooling zone sooner than later, but its not ideal."

T. Wright,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,Tips to keep your glasses from breaking (hopefully).,"I gotta say that if these don't break, I love them. I've found that I can pour 3-4 cold beers into one glass over the period of a few hours, and it stays very cool. The gray ""rubber band"" keeps my fingers comfortable on what would be a VERY cold glass. I would have given them 5 Stars except for a few things.  First off, they are NOT pint glasses. The outside is about the same size as a standard ""glass"" pint-glass, but because of the insulating gel and double-walled construction, the actual capacity is just over 12 ounces. This is not a huge deal as most bottles and cans are 12 oz, but it's worth mentioning.The other reasons for knocking off a star have to do with ""special handling"" that I do to prevent them from breaking.1) I would avoid using them to cool down a warm beer. Putting something warm into something that is very cold causes expansion stresses in the glass, which can cause it to split apart at the seam. I know, the product description says you can use it this way, but if you want them to last a long time, keep your beer in the fridge, then pour it in the glass. It will stay ice-cold for a looonng time!2) I shouldn't have to tell you to hand-wash these, as that's what the box says, but I've noticed in the ""Questions"" section that some people said they can go in the dishwasher. NO. The weld that seals the gel inside is the weakest part of the glass, so it shouldn't be subjected to sudden or extreme changes in temperature. Here's what I do to clean them. Leave them on the kitchen counter until the gel isn't frozen anymore- at LEAST a few hours. Wash them in lukewarm (roughly room-temperature) water. Leave them on a drying rack to dry COMPLETELY before refreezing.3) Put them in the freezer standing upright. Do NOT lay them on their sides or put them upside down. As the gel freezes and expands, this gives it room to expand up towards the seam. (The gel stops expanding just below the seam.)  If the gel is already at the seam when it starts to freeze, it puts added stress on the seam.This is a minimal amount of additional ""work"" to keep the glasses working for a long time, but I'm disappointed that I should have to do it at all. These glasses were a great idea that was poorly executed, and with bad usage suggestions in the description."

They're sturdy with a heavy base and heavy.There are a total of 8 of each size, the 20 ounce highball and the 10 ounce tumbler.I like the slightly smoky tint to the glass that isn't too dark or colorful to be tacky.The only thing I will nit-pick is that I received a small tumbler with noticeable ""dings"" in the glass -- as if they'd been dropped on sharp gravel -- they didn't brake, but just left little gouges in a single tumbler, almost as if it either failed quality control or was a factory second. (see photos). It's not likely it occurred in shipping because everything was packed very well, with little chance to cause that kind of pits in the glassIt's not a game-changer, but I like for brand new items to be new and unblemished with scratches or nicks. I deducted a star for that.As it is, we can't use the chipped up tumbler because there's a good chance the defects could cut someone if they held the glass right where the chipped areas were. They don't seem to affect the integrity of the glass, but it's not worth the risk.Overall, it's a nice set of glassware to replace your outdated stuff or for a new set of decent glasses."

I really like them, and haven't seen anything else with quite the style these have. But they do seem to be more fragile than most. At $35 for a set of 4, I'm still debating. BUT, the fact that I'm debating even though I know they are fragile should tell you how much I like what I have. Too fragile, so they're not a 5. But they're really nice, so it's a solid 4 from me."

I love them anyway because they feel great in my hand and I love their unique shape and perfect size for mixed drinks and water.  I wish Anchor Hocking would find a way to make their glass products more hardy.

JTAGUY,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful looks like real glass...But...,"I was looking for an unbreakable set of small glasses. I saw these and they looked perfect. They came as described and looked really nice. They ship them in packages of 3 snapped into each other, I bought 12 so it had 4 sets of 3 each in plastic shrink wrap (shown in picture). As I was looking for how to care for instructions, I noticed something that made my stomach drop. This is what it said:  Hand wash only; not microwave, dishwasher or heat friendly. I missed that and that's on me. I'm just passing along so you know ahead of time.That's why I only gave it a 4 star rating since they cannot be washed in a dishwasher or heat friendly. I would never microwave a glass so I wasn't worried about that incompatibility. These are beautiful glass like plastic cups. Of course I had to challenge their claim of being unbreakable. I threw it on the tile in the kitchen and it just bounced a few times. No cracks, marks or blemishes at all. So for that, I recommend these if you don't mind handwashing."

The only thing I don't like about these new style Lenox glasses is they have a dip in the bottom so when it's turned upside down in the dishwasher it collects water. When you take it out of the dishwasher the water in this little dip runs down the side of the glasses and you have to dry them by hand.

Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Low quality, lack of quality control, actually made by Crisa","Edit/update: so I've had these for a while now, and I have to admit that despite their defects, they're kindof growing on me. I still like their design, and the thickness of the glasses is good. I just wish their quality was better. Libbey did send me free replacements which was nice, but the replacements still had problems. They were better than the original ones I had overall, but not by like a ton. They still had some problems. Despite that, I have to admit that having had them for a while, I kinda like them despite their imperfections. I just wish so much that they were higher quality because I love the design. It's a real shame. Libbey has this one major flaw which is some kind of problem with quality, either with quality control or manufacturing, I'm not sure. Their designs are great, but the quality on them is just not great.Despite that, I'm finding that I do like these glasses.So, if you can live with lots of small imperfections, I think these are actually great glasses. You just have to live with imperfections, which sucks, but oh well. Libbey's customer service is good, but I honestly would have prefered if they'd just fixed their problem with quality and manufacturing rather than sending me free glasses. The free glasses were nice, but I just wish they would get their act together on quality because their products are actually great. Anyway, I like these glasses despite their flaws, and I think you'll find much the same experience if you can stand the small imperfections.Original review:I bought these because I was expected high quality glasses. I had read the other reviews, and was mostly concerned about broken glasses. What I should have been more concerned about was the reports of low quality. Just one of these problems in and of itself wouldn't be so bad, but there are a lot of problems that affect almost every glass:Every single glass has a tilted base/bottom inside the glass. The tilts are all different, some aren't so bad, a few are very noticeable. One of the short glasses doesn't even have a flat base at the very bottom of the glass. One of the tall glasses leans to one side, like it's slouching. All of the glasses have small bubbles and other imperfections on them. The tall glasses all have noticeable seams running down their sides, some of the short glasses do as well. Some of the glasses have small dents and other impressions. The tops of the glasses are not very level, though this is fairly minor. One of the glasses has a black spot in the glass on the outside, no clue what it is or why it's there, seems to be part of the glass or something. Every glass has a scar-like seam at the bottom, looks like a cut that's been stitched. There are lots of points where it looks like the glass has been slightly pinched or something during manufacture.I dishwashed all of these glasses, mind you. They seem sturdy, and if it weren't for these imperfections, this would be a fine glass set. But there are just so many imperfections. The lack of a flat base inside the glass makes every glass just look off. They just look kinda poorly made.I'm dubious about returning them. If I exchange them for more of the same, I'm afraid I'll just end up with the same problems. If I buy other glasses, who is to say if they'll be any better? I was hoping that by buying Libbey, I'd be buying some high quality glasses, but that isn't the case.These don't even have the Libbey L on the bottom. They say Crisa on the bottom because apparently Libbey owns Crisa. So although these claim to be Libbey glasses, they're actually Crisa glasses manufactured by Crisa which Libbey owns. I originally also ordered some heavy base glasses from Libbey, but cancelled those after looking at the low quality of these.If you're looking for cheap glasses and don't really care what they look like, then I guess these will do. But if you're looking for high quality glasses, buy something else. These are low quality."

Pen Name,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,Basic and inexpensive high and lowball glasses,"These clean and clear tumblers come with no frills and no promises.  They may be thinner than some other brands, but then, they are amongst the lowest priced sets offered on Amazon.  So while some reviews are crabby about ""easily broken"" the product is indeed made of glass and will succumb to intentional or unintentional trauma.  I like the simple yet elegant look of these glasses and appreciate the balance of the heavier bottom.  They are a good value, arrived well packaged to protect from breakage during shipment, and are a good choice for everyday drinking glasses.  I do not recommend using them for any other purpose than to hold a delicious beverage and please, take appropriate care when handling any glass item."

Not a Serial Reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024",4.0 out of 5 stars,Hand wash only!,"This set of 6 glasses was packed well, each in its own individual bubble wrap and cardboard to protect them. The feel and look hit the mark for the on-trend vintage vibe. They have a lovely weight to them which is part of the fun of drinking a craft cocktail. I'm super disappointed that they have to be hand washed. The only reason I can think of for this is I ordered the sage color, and the color is NOT green glass. It's a colored coating around the glass sidewalls, which you can tell when you turn the glass over. The bottom is clear. I predict putting this through the dishwasher would shrink the colored coating and then you'd have clear glasses. Maybe I'll do that when I'm tired of the sage and want clear barware. ;-)"

The design is pretty with a nice texture on the outside and a smooth surface interior.  The bottom is weighted and they feel nice in your hand. They went through the dishwasher and don't collect water because of the flush bottom, which is a nice little perk. I would be happy to have another set."

We got the clear ones, as we'll be putting them in our home bar we're creating, and we're not quite sure if our glassware will have a color scheme yet, so you can't go wrong with clear! I'm perplexed why they are not dishwasher safe, and why the Kate Aspen website says to not put hot drinks in them (cold drinks only). They seem sturdy enough so I'm not sure if they would crack from heat? Or if there is a chemical in the glass that makes it unsafe to expose to heat? I posted this question on the Kate Aspen website to ask, and I'll update my review if they answer. For now, I'm taking one star off for the inability to put a hot drink in them."

The Girl Utah,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice set to give you options- Im happy!!,"I needed a set of cocktail drinking glasses for our place in Tacoma- not a set that would see a lot of use but, be ready when we were!! Of course, when we do get the time to sneak away- it‚Äôs always for some adulting time.. So, I decided to stock the glass cupboard with a few solid drink glasses.. whisky short, wine stems, beer mugs.. Only, we were missing the ability to serve cosmos or margaritas in anything but, a red solo- (I know, tragic!) Although, a coupe isn‚Äôt usually used for Margarita fish bowls.. these could double as both!! I‚Äôm loving that.With a set of four, it‚Äôs perfect to finish off The different variations in our cupboard.. and it should be noted bc, these run a tad bigger then a regular coupe- they can make a pretty solid Margarita glass if we so desire! This was an added bonus I found after arrival.. yay!These glasses appear to be of clear blown glass- not foggy or, scuffed. They have a thinner rim which, I prefer for drinking from...  BUT, feel it will be necessary to use extra care not to chip to top edges. In fact, I had to put a foam liner on the shelf so when putting away and storing.. I don‚Äôt accidentally bump and chip the edges...However, on the flipside the base feels wide/weighted enough to be sturdy and not feel tipsy.. very ergonomically correct.I recommend for anyone wanting a solid cocktail glass set without having to invest high $ to get one- for the price point, and the option for Use with multiple drinks.. this is a solid find. Note: this can also be used for a dessert parfait or even a fruit cup as well!  Anyone looking for a set to give options- this is a good one! I hope this info can help your decision.. Feel free to let me know!"
Slashlilystar,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Delicate but beautiful,"Nicely shaped champagne coupes. Good clarity. 7oz to the brim but comfortably holds 5oz. This is a nice alternative for a conical martini glasses or Nick and Nora glasses. For serving champagne a perfectly acceptable alternative to flutes. They are a bit delicate, so hand washing is a must. Knocking one over on the table is enough to break it so it‚Äôs not the most sturdy."
MussSyke,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Fragile more than delicate,"I like using coupes for my non-Martini cocktails, like Manhattans.  Since these are quite a bit larger than my other Coupes, and I don't have any Margarita glasses I love, I've taken to using them for Margaritas.  For that reason, I am giving them four stars, but I am tempted to give it three.These hold about 6 to 7 ounces instead of the 5.5 to 6 ounces that my others hold.  I wouldn't go bigger because these are meant for cremants or classic cocktails versus long drinks, but I already think these are a too big because the rim is just wide enough that they don't fit in the common slots of my dishwasher, which is really annoying, especially because they are a bit too fragile; I broke one almost immediately.I'm not overly crazy about Riedel, but since it's a common brand I'm familiar with, I will make some comparisons:  Riedel tends to be really thin glass, but it's also super clean, clear, and perfect.  Good for fancy, but almost better for special occasions as to not break them on a regular night.  These are Riedel thin, but they show imperfections and they seem to be more fragile, considering I already broke one.Definitely like coupes.  But I like my others better for Manhattans and everyday use."
RockyRoad,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Classic Champs,"Yes, these are the true coupe, the classic champagne or champagne cocktail glass, revered for decades. Arguably since ancient Greece, when bowl shaped stemmed vessels appeared, and refined in the 1700s.Of course, the photo is not champagne but sudsy water to best show the shape.They are bar or restaurant quality, meant to withstand a bit of abuse. More sturdy than delicate. Quite straightforward.Would have preferred a thinner rim for a more elegant sip.Nice retro change of pace from flutes.Cheers!"

The tumblers are nice so far.  Don't ""sweat"", keep drinks cold, and come through the dishwasher in good shape after a month of use.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was due to the description and not the fault of the  product.  The tumbler is listed on Amazon as having a ""16 ounce capacity"" which overflows out of the tumbler.  It holds 12 ounces of liquid comfortably.  That happened to be the capacity of the old tumbler I was replacing.  I had guessed something was off with the ""16 ounce capacity"" and ordered anyway.  Happy I did.  I don't know why this particular set of tumblers is described as holding 16 ounces."

I haven't experienced the clouding that others have experienced just yet, but I'll definitely update if needed.The only disappointment was not with the cup itself, but with the slightly confusing product pictures. The pictures include a picture with just the black lid and an ""accessories"" picture listing all color lids and straws. The reason this is confusing is because the black one doesn't specify that it is NOT included with the cup, but the accessory picture does specify that everything in the picture is NOT included. It is NOT OBVIOUS that the cup DOES NOT at least come with a black lid without looking at the reviews and QA section.This product otherwise has been very good to me and I recommend for coffee and tea drinkers!"

ComfyShoeMaven,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Tumbler,"I love red, so when I saw this tumbler, I just had to order it. That, plus the fact that it can be put in a microwave. I haven't tried that yet, because I got this for cold drinks. Not all double-walled brands are the same and, while some do produce condensation, this one doesn't. It also says it's dishwasher-safe, but I'm going to hand wash mine, just to be safe.I do wish it was a bit thinner higher up, because I have small hands, and in order to get a good grip on it, I have to hold it more toward the bottom. I have a holder in which it fits, but don't like to use it all the time. Also be aware that, like most double-walled glasses, this doesn't comfortably hold a full 24oz. I'm OK with that, because I just needed 20oz, and it handles that amount well. Further, like most plastic items, the lip isn't smooth, and it feels a little rough on the mouth. It isn't horrible, but I do wish they would find a way to fix that. For these reasons, I docked it a star.Other than that, I really like this tumbler, and have already ordered th 16 oz version to use for coffee."

I wasn't aware these tumblers came with a lifetime guarantee but I noticed they claim so on the box and on the bottom of my older ones, thing is how do you go about exchanging 2 of the 4 tumblers.  If I had noticed the cloudy appearance of the 2 before opening the box I would have sent the whole set back.  All in all these are an EXCELLENT everyday drinking tumbler, just check for the cloudy ones before opening the box."

I wouldn't really consider taking this on a road though, I'd go with stainless steel to keep beverage cool/hot for a longer period of time.The only downside is this type does NOT come with a lid (they do sell mugs with lids, though; ""Tervis Clear & Colorful Mug Insulated Tumbler with Black Lid, 16 oz Tritan, Clear"").They have pictures of the lids with this item, though, so I was confused when this arrived & had no lid.To Note- although the mugs are 16 oz, the 16 oz LIDS are too small- the correct side of lid to buy is 24 oz. The 24 oz lids fit the 16 oz mugs. (I had trouble finding the right sized lid...)"

Ashley watcher,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,I like them so far.,"So I read all the 1 star reviews and decided to do a really good look over on these before I kept them.Not a single one was broken, not a single one is purple, and not a single one has cracks or chips.They did come dirty, but that‚Äôs okay because there is a paper in the box that states they are shipped directly from the manufacturer and that they need to be washed. It‚Äôs cardboard powder and it came off with a rise.The base is thick and sturdy, while it does thin out a lot towards the top, so if you don‚Äôt like thin glass this isn‚Äôt for you.These are gentle glasses, but in my opinion all glass should be cared for gently. Otherwise I recommend getting plastic or acrylic.Also it‚Äôs glass it‚Äôs not 100 percent perfect. It will be as close as possible to perfect, but there are chances it will have slight bubbles, bumps, and even be a tiny bit taller or shorter.These specific glasses I received are all practically identical.We will see how they handle in a dish washer although I‚Äôm more of a wash by hand person."
Leah Cox,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality glasses,Everything arrived intact. The glass is somewhat thin though. Just be careful with them.
Shanna,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2023",4.0 out of 5 stars,Funky Glasses,I got these because they‚Äôre different. They‚Äôre sturdy and the glass is thick. The seam is visible and you can feel it which is a little annoying. I was not expecting it to take so long to get used to drinking out of them.
Rachel,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Repeat purchase,"We like the look of these glasses, seem to have to order a new set every 8 months or so as they tend to break in the dishwasher easily. No other issue breaking otherwise. Good look."
Phyllis Selvaggio,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Coolest Drinking Glasses!,"I am in love with these glasses!  They are weighted on the bottom so they don't tip over easily, and the curve in the glass makes it ergonomically fit your hand perfectly.  They look great!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is for quality.  On some of the glasses, you can see and feel the seam where the two sides were melded together.  Other than that, they're awesome."

Most of them were perfect, one had glass threads inside, which snapped off but then there‚Äôs still a little sharp spot on the bottom. So that one holds my paintbrushes, no big deal to me. The weight really is nice, these are very stable, heavy enough it can safely hold my larger long handled brush painting brushes, but not so heavy that it feels clunky or is unpleasant to use."
A consumer,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,"These are well made. But, the large size and flared shape are a bit too wide for the dishwasher rack. Also, the flared angles cause them to tip into and bump into each other on the shelf, rather than slide easily when pushed together, when arranging them on the shelf or reaching around them. I would buy a different shape next time, a straight cylindrical styled (boring) type tumbler."
Ralph D. Bianco,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,Great look - break easy,We love the look of these glasses but they broke and cracked very easily.

So I was surprised to see the texture is inside the glasses since I don't believe that was mentioned in the description. I do like the glasses although they tend to sweat a lot and definitely require some sort of coaster.

Derb,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2022",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not for people who are anal/OCD, but cheap & serviceable","The glasses feel sturdy and were packaged well. However, there‚Äôs so much variation in the shape of them that it‚Äôs kind of comical. Hard to tell from the pic because of the glare, but each glass is slightly different in overall height, slope of side wall, thickness & slope of base, and thickness of rim. Sometimes this is a plus/feature for handmade glass, but these are definitely machined. So if it is important to you for your glassware to be matchy-matchy, or if you are a person who is bothered by small imperfections, I would not get these.Also, the first set I received had a small but noticeable bulge/drip on many of the rims which I didn‚Äôt like, but they immediately shipped me a new set when I requested a return, so I was at least impressed by the customer service."

Overall, after owning these several years, I have NOT broke another glass, but I will be donating these due to the fact that I probably haven‚Äôt broken these because I am afraid to use them unless I have guests over. They are in fact very thin as other reviewers mention. I find that I am reaching for a tumbler, or water bottle over these on a regular basis and decided to invest in a stronger glass that doesn‚Äôt scare me to use it."

I am always pleased with the quality of Libby's products.  they harken back to when things were made to stand up to normal life and last a long time.When I buy Ikea glasses, I know they'll all be broken in a year.  So that's why I chose to go with Libby.  We still have libby glasses that my Grandmother purchased in the 50's.  They stand up  to dishwashers, kids  pets and tired parents. Price was attractive, as well.

Redvinemama,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2016",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Clean, simple style.","I searched long and hard for a simple juice glass and found almost exactly what I was looking for in these Libbey glasses. It is amazing how many unattractive or impractical juice glasses are on the market, and how hard it is to find glasses that are plain clear glass and cylindrical in shape. The solid heavy base makes these glasses stable.  There is a slight ripple in the middle of each glass that is not apparent in the photograph online and is not mentioned in the description.  I thought it was a defect when I unwrapped the first glass, but decided it is an intentional design feature, since it is in every glass.  Although surprising, it is not objectionable.  My only disappointment is that I was hoping to find a 6 ounce juice glass, but found only these 5 ounce glasses that satisfied all of my other criteria, so I chose to compromise on the size rather than on the style."
P. Willson,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect dessert portions!,"Glad to find these glasses,  since I'm down to my last two and couldn't find them in local stores -- they're quite sturdy, but glass and I have this fundamental misunderstanding...They would be a little too small for morning juice, IMO, but at about 3.5 ounces (that's what they actually hold -- 5 oz is right to the brim) they are perfect for serving a cordial or liqueur or dessert sherry over a bit of ice.  I often make little individual desserts for portion control, and these look more elegant than small bowls and take up less space in freezer or fridge. Try a parfait or mini-trifle with a bit of pound cake drizzled with liqueur, a spoonful of fresh fruit, and a dab of ice cream (or whipped cream or soft custard) -- or a small serving of warm apple crisp (or sliced grilled peaches!) with a spoonful of ice cream. Or a small serving of a rich drink like a White Russian.  You feel indulged, and the risk of plowing mindlessly through seconds or thirds (or the whole serving dish) is reduced."
ANGELICA RAGUSA,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2015",4.0 out of 5 stars,VERY SMALL,"These glasses are very cute but I was kinda surprised by how small they were. I was expecting a standard sized juice glass, for what ever reason the 5 Ounce description didn't register with me. I won't give a poor review because that was my own fault but I had to return them unfortunately because they were too small for my liking. I like a lot of juice. I have the matching set of these glasses in the larger size."

Frequent Purchaser,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Just plain fun!,"Recently, I started harvesting wild prickly pear cactus fruit, and making prickly pear margaritas for my wife and me.  We didn't have proper glasses though, until I spotted these.  I mean, all margaritas have that southwest feel, but a glass that looks like a saguaro cactus and has a cactus-based drink, how can you beat that?  They look great and my wife enjoys the drinks even more.  Exceeds my expectations for fun and enjoyment.  See below.Most people start out reviews from one of two positions.  About 5% of all reviews are a one star because the product they received was poor quality, or they did not get it all and the consumer is just mad.  I don‚Äôt believe 5% of every product made goes out useless, but everyone who gets a bad unit will tell you.About 90% of reviewers start at 5 stars, and if the reviewer did not find anything heinous about the product, that‚Äôs what they give.  To 90% of people, 5 stars means, ‚Äúit was just ok.‚ÄùFrom this day forward, my reviews start from the middle.  Three stars: the product met my expectations.  If I give it four stars, the product exceeded my expectations for quality, value, or performance. In case of five stars, the got itself out of the box itself and walked across the water.If I give a product two stars, it failed to meet my expectations in some way.  Anything deserving the ignominious one star review either went back to the vendor or in the dumpster."
Island Mermaid,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful, but sooo small!","I giggled out loud when I opened the box. It‚Äôs on me, I should‚Äôve paid attention to the dimensions, but I just never dreamed margarita glasses would be so short & tiny! So, these diminutive, 4-inch (only 4-inch!) glasses were quite a surprise, & actually, an adorable & amusing sight! The only bummer: I need way bigger margarita glasses than this! These don‚Äôt hold much liquid at all in the first place, & if you add ice, it‚Äôll be that much less. So unfortunately, they‚Äôre not completely practical for me; that said, however, I still might keep them! Why? Because 1) they have a beautiful, modern design, 2) they are a pleasure to hold, as the small, smooth base fits nicely in your hand, & 3) their small size really does make them adorable, & I think they‚Äôd charm everyone & give them a chuckle. So, I do still recommend them, as long as you are aware of the dimensions & are okay with very small margarita glasses. Maybe you would put a whole pitcher on the table, & then just keep refilling the glasses? I hope the manufacturer will eventually make & offer a larger size in this same design, though, as I do love every single thing about them except for their size."

The only negative about that is there is no original box as you would find in stores, which is a minor issue if you intended to give them as a gift as I do.  Also no way of knowing if they are new or, in fact, Libbey glass even.  But the glasses themselves are beautiful and look very solid, so it‚Äôs a trade off.  I think the recipient will love them regardless, so really just a small issue on my part."

Cinda Quil,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,"arrived scuffed, but usable","They came packaged all shrink-wrapped together in a row with no cushioning between them, so each glass came scuffed on at least one side (the middle ones are marked on both sides) so that is unfortunate.  Otherwise the glasses are very cute, a nice simple shape that is perfectly sized for a good portion of drink that is still easy to hold.  The bottom of the glass is thicker than the sides so it won't tip over very easily, altogether it feels pretty sturdy.  Definitely wish they were packaged better though."
Alexa Wood,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2021",4.0 out of 5 stars,Packaging needs work,"I absolutely love these glasses! Unfortunately, the way they are packaged leads to the glasses rubbing against each other during shipping, causing small etched spots where there was contact."

Grace Merchant,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty for the price. Durable? Eh...,"Purchased these after much reviewing and after our first set of similarly styled glassware from a Bullseye-Themed Competitor, hoping that this would be a step up. The verdict 6 months later: ....meh?They look and feel miles better than the starter set you'd pick up at the store. The bottom is significantly weightier, helping with stability on a surface and when you hold it in your hand. They don't cloud up, even in our old grandpa of a dishwasher. This set is probably intended for more everyday use (which is how we're using it), but it's a classy enough style that you'd feel comfortable serving up a fancy drink or two.That is, of course, if you have a full set remaining by the time your guests arrive. Over the last six months, we've lost a good three of the eight taller glasses due to chipping in the dishwasher and the occasional crack if you tap them against another glass accidentally stacking them in the cupboard. Turns out these are less durable than a toothpick. The shorter glasses have fared better than their older siblings; maybe it's an issue with the strength in the middle of the glass?This is disappointing, especially considering the reputation Libbey has for glassware. I know that it's glassware we're talking about here, not WWE fighters, so I know you have to be a little more careful with them. But alas, I was hoping to get a stronger set this time around. Long story short, if you're going to go with this set, expect to buy your replacement in a year or so. (Or sooner!)"

Not bad at this price point, but should be labeled as such. Specifically, not all of the glasses are the same height, with each being just a fraction of an inch different. Only noticeable if they‚Äôre right next to each other, but annoying nonetheless. A bigger miss is the ‚Äúglob‚Äù of extra or misshapen glass on the rim at the top of the glass.

None of them arrived broken due to packing or shipping issues.  However, one of the tall cups had a pretty obviously warped lip and a sharp point inside the glass where that warp was.  (Someone likely packed that box and said ""ha, that's good enough"" as they put in the dud.)  This was pretty disheartening since my goal was to have a complete set of 12 of each size.  The warped cup went into the garbage directly as potentially dangerous and I got 12 short cups and 11 tall cups in good condition.  For the price I didn't expect to be amazed, but I certainly hoped that the full set I paid for would have arrived and been usable."

That's how fragile it is, the glass doesn't even hold its own weight at an angle.We dug out our prior set, which we hadn't yet dropped off to a resale shop, and are now using them again.

Wendy Morriss,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,One of the small glasses was broken right out of the box.,"I love these glasses overall. They are beautiful, and the dimples make them very easy to hold.June 16, 2021:However, when unboxed, one of the small glasses was broken right out of the box.  The bases of the glasses are solid, but going up toward the top they get kind of flimsy.  The rest of the glasses seem to be ok so far.It would be very nice if it were possible to just replace one glass. I honestly cannot box the whole thing back up and return it to Amazon over one glass, and I know that Libbey knows that most folks cannot do that either. But the requirement to send the whole shebang back for refund, and get a replacement set that may have broken glasses as well, I really don't like that.The likelihood that I will purchase glasses from Libbey in the future, no matter how pretty, is 0%.Edit June 16, 2021:Other than the one glass broken on delivery, no others have broken. We are kind of hard on glassware, and I do wash them in the dishwasher, so they are holding up, which is why I am revising my review to a 3."

We‚Äôve never had cups break while being washed in the dishwasher, but this brand just hasn't held up well at all. We have a LG dishwasher so nothing fancy about it to break these cups.They are stunning and well crafted, but we‚Äôve hadn‚Äôt had luck with them lasting! Sad, because I really liked them too."

They absolutely love the shape and weight of the glassware, were thinking of buying an additional set for future use. Unfortunately, a couple weeks ago they let me know a chunk of the base broke off without reason, which would be quite unsafe if someone had been drinking from it at the time; and today they sent me photo of the base of a glass separated from the sides. They have enjoyed using this glassware but mixed feelings about it since they do not hold up very long."

J Manley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not like the original.  Disappointed.,"I have a set of these glasses (Libbey Impressions) that I've had for many years.  Over time, a glass has gotten broken here and there so I ordered an entire new set to add to what I already have.  This new set does not live up to the old version.  The ""impressions"" (dimples) are more shallow than the original.  Also, the glass feels a little different.  It seems more plastic-like, if that could even be a thing.  The glasses are more lightweight than the originals.  If I didn't have the originals, I probably would like these just fine.  Perhaps the manufacturer has had to cut corners to keep their price down.  I love ordering from Amazon, but sometimes wonder if there's a lot of price pressure on the manufacturers and we consumers end up on the short end.  If given a choice, I would have paid more to be able to have the same quality as the older version."

But, in a little over a month, three of the tall glasses have broken and one cracked in the dishwasher leaving some big chunks in there which is not great.  It's the thinness of the glass at the top of the tall glasses that is the fragile part. The short glasses are all still intact."

Another had some cracking along the outside of the glass but it was broken. I think it must‚Äôve gotten made wrong and the glass got cracks inside it.

I got eight of the tall and eight of the short. I was really proud to have my own nice stuff. When I got them they looked and felt nice and they had a nice weight to them. The first year they held up well. The second year a couple broke which I attributed to clumsiness on my part. Four years in and I have three of the short glasses and two of the tall glasses left. They break randomly when you pick them up, when they‚Äôre just sitting in the sink, and when they go through the dishwasher. We‚Äôve had the tall glasses break where you go to pick them up and the top half comes off almost as a whole ring and the rest just stays on the counter. We make sure not to crowd our dishwasher and they‚Äôll come out with small pieces broken out of the side. It seems to be more often the older they get, to the point that two of them broke this week.

Scott Wegner,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite 16oz - but okay mug,"I bought these mugs specifically because I have been buying beer in 1pt (16oz) cans lately - and I can tell you for sure that even though they claim to be ""16oz"" mugs - the certainly are not.  I know this because when I pour a 12oz can of beer into one of these mugs - it first perfectly and keeps it very cold.  But when I pour a 16 can of beer into the mug, it does NOT fit and there is a bit of beer left in the can.  The bad news, and the reason I only gave it 3 stars, is that they advertise the mugs as 16oz mugs and they are not.  Well... I'm not sure what planet they get their measurement standards from... but it is certainly not earth."

RNCrawford,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,A decent chiller glass,"I was really torn between giving this a 3 or a 4 as it's not quite a 4 but better than a 3 as I try to be fair about my experience with these cups.  In the end I had to err on the side of a 3 after factoring in the price.Pros: Good form, size and grip band.  The gel between the walls freezes in about an hour and does a good job keeping liquids cold with the caveat mentioned below.  Makes for an attractive gift.Cons: Not enough gel between the chambers.  While I understand that there has to be enough room for the gel to expand as it freezes, the manufacturer could easily add half again as much and still have that necessary space allowance.Why is this is a issue?  Because when set upright in the freezer, the gel comes up to just under half the cup's height, which in turn keeps everything at the gel line or below reasonably cold, but anything above it noticeably less so.  If you let it set for a few minutes that difference is even more noticeable.  A better design would be to use vertical silos for the gel so that it would chill the contents from top to bottom, rather than bottom only, or perhaps a lattice of honeycomb shaped cells.Also, don't expect this to keep your beer or other drink cold very long, the gel thaws completely 30-ish mins after setting out in a 80 degree room, and even quicker if exposed to sunlight like at a outdoor grilling."
Gina,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Once frozen it changes shape,Bought these as a gift for my husband. After we put them in the freezer when he took it out to use it they had become oval shaped. Only the bottom part of the mug got cold and the top half was at room temperature. He said he prefers a frozen mug because he likes the entire glass to be cold and he didn‚Äôt like the shape it froze into. We let it thaw out completely to see if the original round shape would come back but it didn‚Äôt. I have a feeling they will crack easily. They also just came in a brown box.

I do not think I would buy it again, but I‚Äôm not going to return it either.  And I certainly would not gift them.  The gel does in fact keep liquids cold for a nice period of time. That‚Äôs pretty great and ultimately the purpose of the item.  But, as you can see in my pictures, the sticky residue from the ‚Äúdo not dishwash‚Äù stickers is pretty bad. I hate when a company puts stickers on and uses adhesive that requires goo-gone to remove the residue. Using that stuff (or anything to remove the gunk) on the plastic will discolor and ruin the item worse.  Also, I presumed that because the item is double wall construction that condensation would not so quickly form on the exterior of the glasses.  Between the frost from being frozen and actual condensation, a substantial wetness does occur on the exterior - even directly on the silicone grip. The outside of the plastic gets super wet when in use.  I won‚Äôt return these, and won‚Äôt buy or gift, and was compelled to write a not so great review.  I don‚Äôt recommend."

But thought I would post on amazon my feeling on this product.We first received the product, about 4-6 months ago.  I was pleasantly surprised they are real glass.  The problem we are having is even though we hand washed them every time they've been used. The plastic plug on the bottom holding in the silicone is now leaking.  I can see a few scratches on the bottom by the plug, so I think they might have rubbed against some silverware. Making a tiny scrape on the plastic material that is used to hold in the silicone material.Otherwise I have been pleased with this product. I just wish they used a more durable material to hold in the silicone, as it makes a real mess.  They do keep your drink extremely cold, it has even frozen some of our drinks and made them like a slushy.  Hopefully the manufacture will change the way these are sealed.  I would try them again if the bottom sealing is changed.So now I have 2 glasses that leak and 2 that don't. I am thinking of using some acrylic on the bottom to see if I can get a better seal."

Ms Me,"Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Elegant but a lot of imperfections,"I'm going to come right out and admit that I am EXTREMELY picky when it comes to any serving items because I buy with forever in mind. This is my first new set of glassware in 20 years, and it took me 2 years to find something good enough. I had to go to 2 different BB&B stores to find enough sets that were not flawed, and even then I wound up with one with a wobbly base. It drives me crazy and I will probably just throw that one away. So many glasses had lips that either had tiny hairline cracks, air bubbles, or were not evenly rounded. Some had scratches from moving around in the boxes. A few had uneven bottoms.  Some had the brand name etched in the bottom and some did not. I would have preferred to not look at a name scrawled in my glass, especially one that isn't mine, but I can deal with it.  The tall glasses are very bottom heavy, so I have to be careful when putting them in the dishwasher. They tip easily. I also have the shorter double old fashion glasses. The shorter ones still have the heavy base but don't tip in the washer. The shorter ones had all of the defects that the taller ones had, plus they are so fat that only a few can fit in my standard size kitchen cabinet. These are not suitable for stacking due to the heavy bases and thin lips.If I didn't have to deal with all of the imperfections, I would have given these 5 stars. They are simple yet elegant and I get a lot of compliments on them. In hindsight, I would have just stuck to one size since the double old fashions hold nearly as much as the beverage glasses, but I would probably stick to the taller ones. I think they look better with dinnerware and they are easier to hold. The shorter glasses are so wide and heavy that people with smaller hands have a hard time getting a good grip. They are especially cumbersome for someone with arthritic hands (like me).  All things considered, I would buy these again. however, these are not something that I would order online and hope for the best. I would definitely buy these in person. I'm willing to bet that the people who complained of these glasses breaking easily probably had defective ones. So far, none of mine have broken, even after tipping over in the dish washer.  I am also aware that some of these are not 20 oz as advertised. I don't think mine are, but it doesn't bother me enough to get out the postal scale and measure the weight of water to be sure."
Paddows,"Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,Love the design but one was badly chipped.,"One of the glasses arrived with a chipped rim.

OceansideJT,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful But Short Lived if Involved With Alcohol,"These lovely glasses should be saved for the most sober occasions as they are delicate and quite fragile.  For everyday drink ware, especially involving any alcoholic beverage, they are out of the question.  After a few of my popular Tequila Nuclear Options during our neighborhood game night, it quickly became obvious these were not going to make it beyond the last round of Twister.  These shatter if turned over on a cocktail table or even dropped a short distance on our very plush carpet.  The next morning at least one was broken and another cracked when they simply bumped against one another in the kitchen sink.  The durability of these glasses is quite disappointing indeed!  However, I still award three stars for their beauty, price when on sale, and the several compliments I received on them from guests in the early evening before our last Twister challenge was canceled due to the danger to bare feet."
Kristin D,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2013",3.0 out of 5 stars,Fragile Glasses,"I had researched glassware to find the best glasses for my wedding registry and these are what we decided upon.  My husband and I received 2 4-glass boxes as a wedding gift.  Immediately I loved them.  They are beautiful, heavy, and clean very easily by hand (no dishwasher :-/).  The only downside is that after 1 year out of the 8 we had received I believe we only have 4 left.  Now I'm not super suave and have my clumsy moments but it does seem as though these glasses are fairly fragile, as glasses can be.  I am however used to sturdier glasses.  So use a bit more care with these, definitely not for child use.  Since I have 4 left I will definitely be ordering some more!UPDATE:  It's been nearly 5 years now with these glasses, and after 12 (possibly 16!)  glasses we now have 4.  They somehow keep breaking, even now in the dishwasher.  I expected these glasses to be of a longer lasting quality.  I have deducted 2 stars and will be purchasing other glasses."

Bridget Jones,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2017",3.0 out of 5 stars,These plastic cups are just OK,"Having read some of the shining 82% 5-star reviews, I bought these 'glasses'. I have to agree with the ones that have warned that these are thinner than expected. For the price, I knew the reality that at about $1 per cup they would not be high end, but you can literally squeeze the tops of these between your thumb and fingers, as if it will snap if you squeeze too hard. I say ""cup"" because they are just not ""glasses"". They are one stage better than the hard plastic Solo cups, but nowhere near the other brands that you get in sets of 4. And, neither is the price. So, I'll keep these because my party is in a week, but would not purchase again. They will be going in the recycle bin after the party, not hand-washed. To note, they do say on the bottom of the cup that they are not for hot beverages or the dishwasher."

However, a couple of caveats about this product.  One, I thought these would be a bit thicker, stronger plastic and although the plastic is stronger than those cheap disposable ones you have to attach to the stem base, or those cheap bulk plastic drinking glasses for soft drinks, it's not quite what we expected.  It's easy to wash the glass by hand for reuse, but beware - don't put it in the dishwasher.  I suppose that's a given considering it's plastic, but I tried one glass out of curiosity and it became distorted and is unusable.  Ironically, the heat from the dishwasher made it a stronger plastic - not pliable at all and actually thicker - basically that is what I thought we would be getting.  Anyway, perhaps the outside of the box they come in should say ""not dishwasher safe"" or ""don't put in dishwasher"".  At more than a dollar a glass it is not a cheap throw-away, for sure.  But, I don't have to worry about using our regular glass stemmed wine glasses for the large group we'll be entertaining.  No cleaning up, no breakage to worry about.  I wouldn't use these for a sit-down dinner though or a small group of people.  Pleased that they are recyclable."

Shame on me..it's not like it was a secret. However, I thought an inexpensive, stackable wine glass would be great, and they look really nice in the picture. Unfortunately the tops are great, but the bases look like any other cheap, disposable blowmolded cup. These are usable wine glasses, but clearly are not designed for reuse or any elegance. If you want to have a nice dinner and use plastic wine glasses, I'd recommend something nicer. If you have a casual party and want to have something cheap and unbreakable to toss rather than reuse, these will do that well. To me, they're kind of expensive disposables, and with just a little nicer bottom, would really look impressive. ."

The verdict 6 months later: ....meh?They look and feel miles better than the starter set you'd pick up at the store. The bottom is significantly weightier, helping with stability on a surface and when you hold it in your hand. They don't cloud up, even in our old grandpa of a dishwasher. This set is probably intended for more everyday use (which is how we're using it), but it's a classy enough style that you'd feel comfortable serving up a fancy drink or two.That is, of course, if you have a full set remaining by the time your guests arrive. Over the last six months, we've lost a good three of the eight taller glasses due to chipping in the dishwasher and the occasional crack if you tap them against another glass accidentally stacking them in the cupboard. Turns out these are less durable than a toothpick. The shorter glasses have fared better than their older siblings; maybe it's an issue with the strength in the middle of the glass?This is disappointing, especially considering the reputation Libbey has for glassware. I know that it's glassware we're talking about here, not WWE fighters, so I know you have to be a little more careful with them. But alas, I was hoping to get a stronger set this time around. Long story short, if you're going to go with this set, expect to buy your replacement in a year or so. (Or sooner!)"

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,Lacking in Quality Control,"I'll start by saying that I like the cups.  None of them arrived broken due to packing or shipping issues.  However, one of the tall cups had a pretty obviously warped lip and a sharp point inside the glass where that warp was.  (Someone likely packed that box and said ""ha, that's good enough"" as they put in the dud.)  This was pretty disheartening since my goal was to have a complete set of 12 of each size.  The warped cup went into the garbage directly as potentially dangerous and I got 12 short cups and 11 tall cups in good condition.  For the price I didn't expect to be amazed, but I certainly hoped that the full set I paid for would have arrived and been usable."
LJ,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice set of glasses,"These glasses almost fit the bill for replacing ones that have broken over many years.

Ryan V.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent starter cocktail set for newly of-age drinkers,"Nice, albeit cheaply made, cocktail glasses.This is a good set when you're ready to move away from the Solo cup to something a little more classy.  The color is very nice - I got the moss green - and the Art Deco pattern adds a touch of Gatsby elegance to a newly-forming barware collection.  The glasses are perfectly functional if not the highest quality.The issue I have with the quality, really, is two-fold:  First, these glasses are not dishwasher safe so they can only be washed by hand.  The glass is relatively thin and not suitable for high temperature cleaning.  Second, the production of the glass left a visible seam where the mold connected around a cylinder.  On higher quality glassware, the glass would be thicker and you would find no seam.  To the credit of these glasses, they did swab negative for lead when tested.While this is not a set I would add to my bar collection, I feel it's perfectly fine for someone just starting out who wants some nice-looking barware without spending hundreds of dollars.  It's cute, presentable, and would look great on a silver or gold bar tray for serving."

The base is wide enough to get a good balance.  Though the top rim could have been a bit thicker (more on this below)Knowing that they only hold about 7 oz, definitely expected them to be small but they are quite short too.  Perhaps that's the way they are designed.  Secondly and most importantly, the quality of the glass doesn't appear to be of the highest quality.  It is just about ok.  Then, the thickness of the glasses isn't too much especially around the rim.  It makes them a bit more fragile than usual and you'll have to be extra careful about them.And for what you get in this package, a set of 4, they definitely appear to a bit expensive so not the best value for money either.Overall, just about ok, passable."

So perhaps they are measuring by the outer layer, before they added the smaller inner cup layer to form the insulation layer, lol???Wouldn't really matter to most folks, but if you have issues around hydration and have to track your half liter mugs of tea to count towards a daily total like I do, then it's annoying to not have that even 500ml capacity. I also just like a huge cuppa and don't want to have to keep getting up to mess about with it, so the 500ml size helps with that.Otherwise, it's a pretty good mug. Lighter than ceramic but still has a decent enough weight to feel solid. Handle is wide/deep enough to be good for large hands, so you can get a decent grip. The insulation design definitely keeps things hotter longer. And it looks like glass not cheap crap plastic, which is nice.But would it have been so hard to size it up a bit? The search continues.

Kathy,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Stains from Coffee,"I luv a couple of good HOT cups of coffee in the morning and tea in the afternoon/evening.  These mugs are wonderful for keeping your beverages hot but over time, the acids(?) in the coffee(?) will breakdown the finish and stain the inside of the cup terribly.  When you put out on average of $10.00 per mug and can't say they last more than 4-6 months of looking good, I have to question buying them again for my coffee mug.  Why doesn't TERVIS say, ""staining may occur from coffee/tea use.""  Then you know what to expect or look for something different."

Biggest problem is missing the gla ss when dispensing ice from the refrigerator. Ice goes all over the place because the top of the glass is so small. Also makes them difficult to hand wash (even my small hand can‚Äôt fit in with a sponge). Probably going to go back to a pilsner style glass and throw these away."

J Manley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not like the original.  Disappointed.,"I have a set of these glasses (Libbey Impressions) that I've had for many years.  Over time, a glass has gotten broken here and there so I ordered an entire new set to add to what I already have.  This new set does not live up to the old version.  The ""impressions"" (dimples) are more shallow than the original.  Also, the glass feels a little different.  It seems more plastic-like, if that could even be a thing.  The glasses are more lightweight than the originals.  If I didn't have the originals, I probably would like these just fine.  Perhaps the manufacturer has had to cut corners to keep their price down.  I love ordering from Amazon, but sometimes wonder if there's a lot of price pressure on the manufacturers and we consumers end up on the short end.  If given a choice, I would have paid more to be able to have the same quality as the older version."

H. Demeny,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,One broken glass.,"Nice thick glass with ridges on the outside.

So, one glass arrived broken."

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as sturdy as expected,I purchased these glasses thinking the glass would be as thick as previous glasses I bought at a local store.  The glass is thinner and I already broke one glass putting it in the cupboard and knocking it against another glass.  The look of the glass is great.
Candice,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs a nice set but had a couple flaws.,"They seem really nice, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to use them because we moved. But I did pull them out of the box and glance at them. 3 had flaws. 2 had really rough edges around the brim, the definitely will need to be sanded because they will cut your mouth. Another had some cracking along the outside of the glass but it was broken. I think it must‚Äôve gotten made wrong and the glass got cracks inside it. But the rest are fine and look exactly like what I was paying for. Just disappointed about the others because I wanted a full 8 set of tall and short glasses."
K. Aggarwal,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Little heavy but good,"Smaller size glasses are little heavy and not very comfortable to hold. In fact, taller ones are better. Design is overall good but quality is not the best. One of the glasses I received had a crack (not to blame anyone, this can happen).  I am fine having one less glass for this set."

Jay schnitzel,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh so-so. Quality let me down,Liked the price. The look. My issue is I can feel jagged pieces of glass on the side of one and on the bottom of a couple others. Nothing that will cut you. Just a jagged little something that keeps it from being smooth.

Liana Pugh,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice looking glasses, don‚Äôt hold up","I bought these four years ago when I first moved out on my own. I got eight of the tall and eight of the short. I was really proud to have my own nice stuff. When I got them they looked and felt nice and they had a nice weight to them. The first year they held up well. The second year a couple broke which I attributed to clumsiness on my part. Four years in and I have three of the short glasses and two of the tall glasses left. They break randomly when you pick them up, when they‚Äôre just sitting in the sink, and when they go through the dishwasher. We‚Äôve had the tall glasses break where you go to pick them up and the top half comes off almost as a whole ring and the rest just stays on the counter. We make sure not to crowd our dishwasher and they‚Äôll come out with small pieces broken out of the side. It seems to be more often the older they get, to the point that two of them broke this week. I liked the cups, they just don‚Äôt last."

I had a good laugh with friends over the size of these and they actually suggested I keep them as chaser glasses, and so I kept them and don't regret doing so because yes, they do work perfectly as chaser glasses!

Just My Opinion,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of goofy and non-functional,"I guess I should have realized that ice would get trapped in the bottom and be difficult to drink from once the liquid got low.

J in OC,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,There are vertical ridges in the glass from the mold - a little unsightly,"It's sturdy enough and quite heavy, but there are slightly raised ridges running vertically down both sides, from rim to base, probably from the mold they used, and it really detracts from the look and feel of the glass. They could have done a tiny bit of grinding and polishing and it would have looked and felt much better. The ridges don't show up in the item photos on Amazon, but can be seen in my attached photo."

Once you add some ice, there‚Äôs barely room for your drink. Unfortunately, that means I‚Äôll be sending them back."
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Too small for margaritas,After buying these for margaritas I started seeing these advertised more for desert dishes because they are so small.

The bases of the glasses are solid, but going up toward the top they get kind of flimsy.  The rest of the glasses seem to be ok so far.It would be very nice if it were possible to just replace one glass. I honestly cannot box the whole thing back up and return it to Amazon over one glass, and I know that Libbey knows that most folks cannot do that either. But the requirement to send the whole shebang back for refund, and get a replacement set that may have broken glasses as well, I really don't like that.The likelihood that I will purchase glasses from Libbey in the future, no matter how pretty, is 0%.Edit June 16, 2021:Other than the one glass broken on delivery, no others have broken. We are kind of hard on glassware, and I do wash them in the dishwasher, so they are holding up, which is why I am revising my review to a 3."

I placed them in carefully, they were not touching any other glass, but when I emptied the racks, a glass would have a 1-2"" broken piece laying next to it.  I thought it was odd and moved on.  Over the course of 6 months, this happened several more times with both the short and tall glasses.  I needed to place a second order to replace the glasses I had lost.  I still don't know the cause of the breakage, but I love the look of glasses.  I want to contact Libbey but don't have their contact information."

I got them in the hopes that I could just keep them in the freezer, grab one, fill it with tap water, and they would be so cold they would bring the tap water down to the perfect temp without the nuisance of me adding ice cubes (don't have an ice cube maker).  And they do exactly that.  Water is just at the temperature I like.  I keep both glasses in the freeze, and can just switch them out whenever I want a cold glass of water.However, the silicone portion of the cup is unpleasantly cold to the touch, so I guess you can't have it both ways. For drinking beer, I would prefer my insulated glasses.Update: EXPERIMENT FAILED. I was keeping a half inch of water in the bottom of the glasses when I put them in the freezer to act as ice cubes  to chill my water faster.  The glass froze and break, destroying the product completely.  I guess these are only good for beer."

Adam Shields,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,Glasses are too thin,"I have a pair of these in the whiskey glass size and the beer glass size. I like the beer glasses better than the whiskey glasses because the orientation of the design is to be a sleeve not a drink chiller. This works well to keep already cold beer cold for longer. I frequently will have a beer as I am cooking or doing other things and it will take me an hour to finish a glass. This works well to keep a beer cold like that.The first time I poured a beer I noticed that it was cold enough that some of the foam actually froze. But any ice formed was thin and melted very quickly.There is also more to the chilled sleeve in the beer glass than the whiskey glass and that also matters in keeping things cold. Like the whiskey glass, the beer glass is just too thin. My beer glasses have not broken yet, but one of the Whiskey glasses broke (in the dishwasher) the third time I washed it."
D_Strasse,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great idea, less so in the real world","The idea behind these beer glasses is great, that is, sleeve a beer glass in a re-freezable ice pack and sleeve the ice packs in silicone so that you can grab the whole thing without freezing your hands.  Except it doesn't work out that well.  How they worked in reality.* My hands still froze.  The silicone sleeve did help but the glass was still very very cold to hold.* Frost developed on the silicone sleeve.  Yes, that's how cold the cup was.* Beer was icy cold.  A positive for a pilsner in the middle of summer but too cold for a brown ale in my opinion.* Tough to remove the silicone sleeve when the cups needed to go into the dishwasher.* Glass cups were thin and I would worry about breakage.After trying these cups as intended, I found that freezing the sleeves made the whole experience just too cold.  That said, I did think that simply chilling the sleeves in the fridge to be pretty nice.  That said, if you enjoy using beer mugs straight from the freezer then these might work for you to keep your beer icy longer.Note: These fit a standard 12oz beer only."

Vegasbrad,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Work Good, Look Bad","They work well to keep beers cold by the pool and the thin drinking edge makes this better than most others, but don‚Äôt expect anything close to perfect finish. Much like other reviewers, I found one had a small but noticeable chip on the side and worse, where the color meets the stainless rim, one was obviously manufactured incorrectly with a pretty substantial blemish and uneven line. You can see it clearly in a pic I took which I‚Äôll attach if I can figure out how. Lucky for me at least both the chip and the manufacturing defect were on the same cup.So if you don‚Äôt care about looks and just want good function, these might be for you. If you do care about looks but only really need one glass, get the two-pack and maybe one of them will look like new if you‚Äôre lucky. Personally for $35 a set, I expect better quality control and am disappointed. Not upset enough to return them, but I am upset enough to write a review to warn others what to expect.

Jason Buskirk,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2019",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Performs admirably, but inconsistent quality means its not worth the premium.","I had purchased the Snowfox martini glasses a while back and decided to pick up the beer tumblers.  My only issue with the martini glasses was the inconsistency of the paint - the pinstripe paint had bled into the base of the martini, creating overlaps in color.  However, this was a minor concern.Upon receipt of the beer tumblers, I noticed that one of them had this same issue with paint bleeding over. These particular tumblers also had large scratches and gouges that had removed the coating and the stainless steel can be seen beneath.These tumblers were shipped in a larger box that contained a second shipment of 4 x 20 oz standard beer glasses, which arrived pristine. The shipping box was whole with no dents or perforations, and the empty space was filled with the appropriate packing materials.  The tumblers themselves were coated in foam and plastic inside their original box. I can only assume that these were issues not observed by or did not concern QC at Snowfox and shipped anyway.From a day to day usage standpoint, I don't doubt that these tumblers would perform as well as the other Snowfox products I own - maintain cold temperatures for a significant time, no sweating, comfortable in the hand.  However, the price of the Snowfox products also includes the design of the product, which is a major selling point for me.  It's not worth paying a premium for a product  that lacks in consistency of quality.Based upon current reviews and my past experience, it seems that this not a unique situation, but uncommon.  So buyer beware."

For aesthetics and chance of getting something that looks damaged out of the box I recommend avoiding the finishes that display the metal grain.  The ones that I got just look awful.  There are lots (many dozens) of scratches and the finish is also slightly uneven. The white ones, on the other hand are perfect.  I can‚Äôt tell by sight whether they are enameled or painted, and who knows how long the finish will hold up, but out of the box they look great.Performance:Last night I pulled one out of the dishwasher and it was HOT.

Luckily nothing broke inside there and we were able to dispose of it.They work great for what they are but I don't think they are dishwasher friendly as the heat cycling might be too much for the fragilely thin glass.

And then you have to clean up thousands of razor-sharp shards of glass out of the bottom of your dishwasher (pro-tip: chew up a pack of bubble gum and then just mush the wad of gum around in the filter. Will have you many spears and cuts to your fingertips.)Also: do NOT just pour hot water out of a teakettle into one of these glasses, because BOOM! It will explode in your hand.Just add a *little* thickness to the glass on these, and they will be perfect. As it is, they are pretty good, but you've really got to handle with care."

It left some in the can and that was without having ice in the glass like most folks would probably want.  The glasses do microwave and freeze nicely. No rings or need for coasters with them. They do look nice too-hence the 3 stars.  That being said, they weren't quite as comfortable to hold as I had hoped.  In all fairness, I am picky about how my glasses hold in my hands.

However , if you treat these like fine china , I think you will be pleased.Final Note: Two of the glasses , in the box of 6 , was broken.  The outer packaging and the individual bubble wrap had no sign of abuse..IMHO, The thin inner box (see picture) inclines me to believe that this is a in-house,  shipping quality control issue.  .Follow up: I sent Ozeri Support the following suggestions:My Reviewer name is Rideo, the review I wrote on Amazon is listed below.I have worked in Transportation Logistics for a number of years including being the owner of a small trucking company.(Retired)My reviews are usually directed to the customer or end user.After, personal experience with one of your glass products, plus reviewing an assortment of customer complaints that are frustrating to both the customer and to Ozeri .... I would like for you to consider the following : A) IMHO ... Since there is very seldom ""outer"" damage upon customer receipt ,leads me to believe, the root of the problem is the flimsy originating box. B) Investing in a multi-wall or multi-cardboard ply for both the box itself plus between the 6 compartments (still using bubble wrap around each glass ) in conjunction with your present Amazon method of shipment, should drastically reduce and/or hopefully eliminate the current damage rate. C) After this,Prior to shipping , for quality control feedback, I would test drop a few boxes now and then at random ( from 2 to 3 ft.) D) Also, keep in mind, a elegant contoured glass (yes,even double wall) tend to ,by nature of it's unique design (Contact Points), be prone to damage, more so than standard drinking glasses. D) Final note, Also I would suggest that the glasses be separated in the dishwasher (or hand washed) as a further precaution . E) These glasses , with the right precautions , can be a great investment. F) The more I make use of mine, the more I like them... they are now my multi-purpose , go to glass of choice ! Kindest Regards, Rideo"
KristyP,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2016",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fun ""floating glasses"" with a great grip",I received these glasses as a promotion in exchange for an honest review. Let's be honest. Glasses hold liquid and these do the job. I haven't used them for hot beverages yet but they do a great job of keeping cold drinks and ice intact. The shape is great for little fingers to grasp and the clear double walls have a floating effect that is admittedly pretty cool. Unfortunately we had one that cracked and let liquid into the interior cavity of the wall so they have not been very durable over all.  Thank you to Ozeri for the chance to sample these glasses.

(Amazon made a 'price adjustment' in the form of an Amazon credit -- which is nice -- but it still took half an hour and left me with four rather than six glasses).My surmise is that the problem was the seller's only insofar as the seller, for some reason, chooses to ship its product by FedEx, which is notoriously hard on packages in my experience; I can't believe this would have happened with UPS -- which has successfully shipped me several Bodum and Epare double-wall glasses, all products arriving in perfect condition.Here's hoping this seller gets the message and selects a better carrier.

Tim Kimzey,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Great...until they BREAK!... but good customer service from Ozeri,"I had been searching for a product just like this: a beautiful glass that would not perspire on your hands and furniture, help keep your cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot. It does just that, and is visually attractive as well. The curve in the surface creates a nice grip for your hand. The glasses are very nice looking and actually work quite well for insulation, keeping condensation off your tabletops.BUT...both of ours are broken in less than a year.The first one cracked AS it was being washed, carefully BY HAND in a dish-pan with warm water. It literally cracked with no pressure or contact with another dish, in my hands as I was washing it. We threw it out.The other one fell off a table onto our floor (about two feet onto vinyl linoleum). As an accident, I cannot fault it for breaking, but I do fault it for literally SHATTERING into dozens and dozens of pieces. My wife and I spent quite a long time picking up many tiny fragments of glass. We then vacuumed very thoroughly. We used high-intensity flashlights to look for pieces and then picked up more. The next day will still found even more tiny shattered slices and splinters of glass.That is the reason I am giving this product one star (even though it does function well and looks nice): the company clearly CLAIMS that the glass used is very tough. You have probably already read the product descriptions:""Heat and shatter resistant borosilicate glasses"" , ""Stronger and more durable than common glass"", ""Completely dishwasher, microwave and freezer safe"", ""Made of durable, heat resistant, mouth-blown borosilicate glass of the finest quality"", ""handmade glasses designed for lifetime use.""Upon one cracking in my hand and the other shattering upon impact, I can without question tell you that the material used in the glasses I received is the most DELICATE and THIN glass that I have ever seen. I am also posting photographs in the product page of the shattered glass as well as a side-view of the thin-ness of a piece of the glass (piece held in my fingers shot with a macro lens). Please do have a look before you judge my review.Also, just of a note: I have seen claims made that Ozeri is a small American company. The box the glasses are packaged in clearly states the product is ""made in China.""I loved these glasses until they both broke, bragged about them to my wife and others. But, they are clearly not very durable. And for the price and the short life-span are very expensive (they cost $10 a piece). I had actually planned on giving them five stars and saying how wonderful they work and how beautiful they are. I wish I could find something similar to replace them, but I cannot. However, I will not buy another set as I would never be able to trust them. I am planning on contacting the company to see how they will honor the warranty (stated one year), and will report my situation later in this review.I hope my experience has been of some help, I am truly saddened that I am writing a bad review for this otherwise great product.***UPDATE  3/3/2014***After contacting Ozeri, they replied to my email within hours. They were friendly and helpful, and after getting my purchase info, sent out replacement glasses to me at no charge. The new set arrived in perfect condition. I must say that i am still very wary of the durability factor of the glass, but they are beautiful and functional glasses, and the customer service from Ozeri is very comforting. I have updated my rating from 1 to 3 stars because of that."
Village Lady,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2014",3.0 out of 5 stars,Ozeri Serafino Double Wall insulated Beverage 12oz,"My daughter bought 4 of these glasses for me at Christmas and I was delighted.  Living in Florida with the heat, my normal glasses would leave a lot of condensation.  I moved on to Tervis Tumblers but I would prefer glass. First she bought the smaller glasses and I thought they were great. They are not forgiving with granite countertops and one of them chipped the glass on the rim. I took the blame on that one and vowed to be a bit more careful in the future.  Now, the first time I used the large glass,I put some ice cubes in the glass and water.  The ice cubes stuck together in the middle of the glass and after a took a sip and the liquid moved down, so did the ice cubes. They immediately popped and hit the bottom breaking the glass completely. It did not injure me but was so close.The glasses are a wonderful idea, I just don't know weather they are strong enough.Judie Johnson, The Villages, FL"

The dent in the middle is aesthetically pleasing and makes the glass easy to hold. My only small complaints were that the lip seems too small to prevent a small dribble from forming where your mouth meets the glass, and the height of the glasses makes it too tall to fit under my one-cup coffeemaker at the mug height, and too short to fit at the thermal car-cup height, so the coffee spit a bit on the way down from the funnel to the glass.However, in two weeks two of the thermal glasses have broken.  Now, I live in a tough house for glassware -- two cats, a big dog with a big tail, a granite counter -- but still, I have glasses, including crystal stemware, that somehow lasts for years. Not these -- one broke one week on when a cat knocked it over.  It didn't even hit the floor, just the chair seat, but the thin outer wall broke.  The second one perished a week later -- somehow it developed a crack around the top in the dishwasher that let water between the two walls. I don't have much hope for the other two lasting much longer.Go ahead and buy these if you want a hot beverage in a nice-looking (if slightly drippy) container, but be prepared to treat them like fragile crystal rather than sturdy everyday glassware."

Curious Wren,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2012",3.0 out of 5 stars,Mine chipped on the rim within the first week,"I was excited to get these glasses, and used them right away for tea.  They feel great in the hand and the liquid looks cool as it floats in the interior space.  However, I took a sip yesterday and felt something odd -- the rim had chipped on one of them.  So now liquid can enter between the two walls (bad) -- so I'll have to toss it.  Not to mention that I might cut my lip on it.  Even so, I guess I'd still recommend them, if replacing them now and again is not an issue for your budget."

lulu,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2011",3.0 out of 5 stars,Breakable,"I was looking for unbreakable drinking glasses because my glass-glasses kept on breaking and I was sick and tired of it. I settled on these because the description stated they were more durable than regular drinking glasses. The description did not say unbreakable, but after having them for a little less than 2 months, I took one glass off the drying rack to drink and I couldn't understand what all the watery debris was within the glass. The inner glass had broke and caused the well of water. I don't know how this happened. I had not been heavy handed with them. Also, I had bought 4 of these and one came shattered. That should have been a tip off. Amazon replaced the shattered glass at no cost. On the plus side, these glasses are quite lovely and are light weight. Unfortunately, I have doubts if the others will uphold well."

However, they were packaged terribly. Each glass was in its own bubble wrap baggie, which was a good start. But then the glasses were just thrown into a box - no cardboard dividers or additional protection. Moreover, the box they were packed in was too big to accommodate the glasses snugly. So, not surprisingly, the glasses shifted around in transit and several arrived broken. At least the bubble wrap baggies prevented the shattered glass from spilling all over the inside of the box, but that‚Äôs really the only positive thing I can say about the packaging. So, if you‚Äôre lucky and your glasses arrive intact, you‚Äôll be very happy with your purchase. But assume you‚Äôll realistically only end up with 9 usable glasses out of 12."

What I did not realize is how much smaller the top diameter is of the gasses. I can see the taper in the online photos, but the taper makes the rim diameter too small for my liking. Biggest problem is missing the gla ss when dispensing ice from the refrigerator. Ice goes all over the place because the top of the glass is so small. Also makes them difficult to hand wash (even my small hand can‚Äôt fit in with a sponge). Probably going to go back to a pilsner style glass and throw these away."
NWS,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Thin and Lightweight,"These were not what I expected.  I thought they were going to be heavy bottomed glasses that would give a good feel when picked up, but they aren't.  They are very thin and lightweight. That it why I question their sturdiness and durability. Time will tell, I've only had them a few weeks."
Sonia ,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,2 lines in the glass,I saw these glasses at a restaurant and fell in love. So I did a picture search and found them on amazon.Absolutely love the shape. Thickness of the glass is nice too. Not too thing that they break easily but not to thick either.Only thing that is bothering me there is a line on each side of the glass. I want to ignore it but I can‚Äôt. Still debating if I should keep them or not. They are on each glass‚Ä¶ the short ones and the long ones.

We‚Äôve never had cups break while being washed in the dishwasher, but this brand just hasn't held up well at all.

They absolutely love the shape and weight of the glassware, were thinking of buying an additional set for future use. Unfortunately, a couple weeks ago they let me know a chunk of the base broke off without reason, which would be quite unsafe if someone had been drinking from it at the time; and today they sent me photo of the base of a glass separated from the sides. They have enjoyed using this glassware but mixed feelings about it since they do not hold up very long."

J Manley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Not like the original.  Disappointed.,"I have a set of these glasses (Libbey Impressions) that I've had for many years.  Over time, a glass has gotten broken here and there so I ordered an entire new set to add to what I already have.  This new set does not live up to the old version.  The ""impressions"" (dimples) are more shallow than the original.  Also, the glass feels a little different.  It seems more plastic-like, if that could even be a thing.  The glasses are more lightweight than the originals.  If I didn't have the originals, I probably would like these just fine.  Perhaps the manufacturer has had to cut corners to keep their price down.  I love ordering from Amazon, but sometimes wonder if there's a lot of price pressure on the manufacturers and we consumers end up on the short end.  If given a choice, I would have paid more to be able to have the same quality as the older version."

But, in a little over a month, three of the tall glasses have broken and one cracked in the dishwasher leaving some big chunks in there which is not great.  It's the thinness of the glass at the top of the tall glasses that is the fragile part. The short glasses are all still intact."

Another had some cracking along the outside of the glass but it was broken. I think it must‚Äôve gotten made wrong and the glass got cracks inside it.

The first year they held up well. The second year a couple broke which I attributed to clumsiness on my part. Four years in and I have three of the short glasses and two of the tall glasses left. They break randomly when you pick them up, when they‚Äôre just sitting in the sink, and when they go through the dishwasher. We‚Äôve had the tall glasses break where you go to pick them up and the top half comes off almost as a whole ring and the rest just stays on the counter. We make sure not to crowd our dishwasher and they‚Äôll come out with small pieces broken out of the side. It seems to be more often the older they get, to the point that two of them broke this week.

Jeff D.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Unable to put in dishwasher,Glasses are large and able to keep beverage cold and ice from melting so quickly. One of the glasses must have a small hairline crack because condensation has built up in one glass and this causes the glass to not work as well as the others. Overall good product for the price. Wish you could put in dishwasher.

Dana L Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT sealed space,"They look nice. They keep the drink pretty cold. However, when I wash them the first time, condensation showed up on the inside of the two pieces of plastic. There's a clear outside piece and a colored inside piece. Obviously, the seal between the two is weak or nonexistent. I've also noticed that you fill the cup up with ice and beverage and OMG more condensate. This time on the exterior of the glass, making a coaster required. Of these (similar) thermal cups I've gotten before, none of the allowed condensation on the exterior due to the vacuum between the layers. Not in this case..... rather disappointed."

JU571N,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,A step short of hobnail heaven,"The good:- clear ones are dishwasher safe- I like the hobnails (I probably like the feel of the hobnails more than I like drinking out of the cup..is that normal?)- truth in advertising; they look pretty much exactly like the pictures.- they are almost the same size on the top as they are the bottom; less chance of tipping.The meh:- Apart from several other reviews I read, I do NOT think they are well balanced and sturdy.  To me, something about the proportions are just slightly off-putting.  I think the design somehow equates with a thicker gauge glass in my brain.  I imagined that they were going to be thick-walled and heavy-based (they are standard-walled and standard-based), but when I took it out of the box and hefted it around, it seemed, if anything, a little middle-to-top-heavy.  I tossed it to my wife and she gave it a quizzical look and sort of had the same response.  I felt good that it wasn't just me being hyper-critical, but there is also a very high chance that we are both drinkware snobs.All in all they seem like a standard-grade juice glass with some cool hobnails.  Ones that would be fine, as the description states, for a hostess gift or a gift for new home owners.  I could see them being used as juice glasses for a weekend brunch, or cups that are a good size for kids to fill up and not waste half a glass of milk like mine do.  But on the same token I would be hesitant to let them use these all the time because I don't want them to get broken and lose all my precious hobnails."

I‚Äôve tried pre-washing them before adding them to the dishwasher, making sure rinse aid is topped off etc, and they inevitably end up with spots and generally cloudy. I really like these but I‚Äôm finding that they have to be wiped out and *polished* before being put to use."
Cleveland guy,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020",3.0 out of 5 stars,No more durable than standard acrylic,"One use, one run through the dishwasher, and they have noticeable scratches.  With all the great reviews, I went all in, buying a set of these rocks glasses, stemless champagne flutes, and stemless wine glasses.  Now I am regretting it.To make matters worse, I thought ""surely this must be dishwasher gunk, I'll hand wash and hand dry it with the towel"".  Then... I realized a.) they were actually scratched, and b.) polishing them with the towel added fine scratches.While these won't break when dropped, don't expect the pretty, glass-like finish to stay for long.  These are too expensive to be scratched after one gentle use."

Emma Rose,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful but easily breakable,"I enjoy the slim design and they serve their purpose well, but the glass is thinner and they are more fragile than I was hoping for. I've already broken a lowball glass by lightly dropping it against the countertop, and a highball glass in my stainless steel sink when it slipped a couple of inches. I have very small hands and can clean the inside of the highball glasses just fine, but most people would need a long-handled dish scrubber to clean them."

Grace Merchant,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty for the price. Durable? Eh...,"Purchased these after much reviewing and after our first set of similarly styled glassware from a Bullseye-Themed Competitor, hoping that this would be a step up. The verdict 6 months later: ....meh?They look and feel miles better than the starter set you'd pick up at the store. The bottom is significantly weightier, helping with stability on a surface and when you hold it in your hand. They don't cloud up, even in our old grandpa of a dishwasher. This set is probably intended for more everyday use (which is how we're using it), but it's a classy enough style that you'd feel comfortable serving up a fancy drink or two.That is, of course, if you have a full set remaining by the time your guests arrive. Over the last six months, we've lost a good three of the eight taller glasses due to chipping in the dishwasher and the occasional crack if you tap them against another glass accidentally stacking them in the cupboard. Turns out these are less durable than a toothpick. The shorter glasses have fared better than their older siblings; maybe it's an issue with the strength in the middle of the glass?This is disappointing, especially considering the reputation Libbey has for glassware. I know that it's glassware we're talking about here, not WWE fighters, so I know you have to be a little more careful with them. But alas, I was hoping to get a stronger set this time around. Long story short, if you're going to go with this set, expect to buy your replacement in a year or so. (Or sooner!)"

Only noticeable if they‚Äôre right next to each other, but annoying nonetheless. A bigger miss is the ‚Äúglob‚Äù of extra or misshapen glass on the rim at the top of the glass.

(Someone likely packed that box and said ""ha, that's good enough"" as they put in the dud.)  This was pretty disheartening since my goal was to have a complete set of 12 of each size.  The warped cup went into the garbage directly as potentially dangerous and I got 12 short cups and 11 tall cups in good condition.  For the price I didn't expect to be amazed, but I certainly hoped that the full set I paid for would have arrived and been usable."

digitaldoc,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2022",3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK standard drinking glass, but surprising little bumps of glass on rims","The glasses are OK and more-or-less as expected.  General, serviceable, not-glamorous drinking glasses that are OK to hold, seem to be dishwasher safe, and hold a decent amount liquid.  The surprising negative thing is that several of the glasses have a pronounced bump out on the drinking rim where the glass ""dripped"" during the molding process.  The sort of thing you see when paint drips on an edge.  There is just one bump on each the glasses where this occurs, but it is surprising that these glasses got thru quality control (if there was any).  You could expect at some point in the future that the bump will get knocked-off and then there will be a cut hazard for users of these glasses.  They'll just have to be thrown away when this happens."

Steve M,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021",3.0 out of 5 stars,Looked to be repackaged from a store.,The glasses them self are fine.  At the bottom of each glass were a number of stickers.  Some glasses had up three different sticks on them.  Some with price sticks on them.  Having to try to peal all the stickers off and get the sticker glue off the bottoms of the glasses was a pain that I was not expecting.  The stickers did not just peel off and there is still sticker glue on some after washing twice.

While I knew I should have inspected them before spending 14 hours creating stencils and etching these glasses, but considering I own many products by this brand, I just didn‚Äôt think about it. 90% of them are perfect, but there were a good handful of them that had bubbles along the rim, warp lines throughout and what looked like ‚Äúbad seems‚Äù on some. And in a couple you could tell the thickness of the bottom was not even around the inside of the cup. Hopefully none of it effects the quality and my time and money doesn‚Äôt go to waste, but I am doubtful I will buy these cups for another project."

JohnnyTea,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,One Tumbler had a Flaw,"We love these tumblers.  It's the second set we've bought.  They look great.  We've had the first set a couple of years.  They haven't gotten cloudy in the insulated air pocket.  They keep liquids cold (no ice  needed when the water is already cold).  They're easy to wash, easy to hold.  They're glass, which we much prefer to plastic.  Guests like them.  The only problem was that on one of the tumblers, the rim wasn't finished well, it's kind of sharp.  I didn't expect that from Bodum.  Not sure if you'd cut your mouth on it or not.  It wasn't worth the hassle of returning so we put it in the back of the cupboard and will remember to be careful if we are down to the last one."
Vexar,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Had them for week and already broke one while cleaning it.,"Shattered in my hands under hot water over the sink, minor cut on my thumb. I think it broke because of the hot water or that I was cleaning the inside? - not a lot of pressure - not really sure at this point. Spent 20 minutes collecting the glass but most of it went into the sink. I suspect the double walled design is a fatal flaw.I liked these glasses until this happened but I got one left and if this breaks I won't get them again."
Gerald C.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Delicate,"Seems to be easily broken. I've been careful, but I found one of my two shattered in both layers at the rim. I used that one for a casual test, dropping it into the trash where I had discarded a jar earlier. I wasn't surprised it broke further, but it shattered violently into many pieces. I knew Bodem's glass was touching from a French press I had, so I guess this is no surprise. But the French press has a protective support of plastic, but the glass, of course, does not. Since it has to be washed and pass thought the dish drainer, I suspect the other one isn't long for this world. Did a good job insulating though."

Once unpacked and inspected, these are very difficult to repack nicely."
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"These glasses are lightweight and has double-paned glass which keeps it from sweating, which is why we bought them. We had the glasses for one month and just recently used all of them. It wasn't until then that we realized two of the six glasses had something wrong with them. One has a small chip of glass attached to the rim of the cup that we cannot remove. The second glass has a hairline chip inside the rim of the glass causing condensation in between the glass panes. Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt be able to use these two glasses anymore. We gave a 3-star rating because we like the product but we are disappointed because our first shipment had broken glasses and had to be returned/replaced. Now our second shipment has 2 damaged glasses. With the price of the product and the fact that it is glass, we would have expected higher quality or at least better protection since it was being shipped. Might be better to purchase from a store vs having it shipped."

They are fragile. I broke 2 of them. One I dropped on the floor and would expect to break. The other I dropped just a few inches when I was washing it in the sink. A normal glass would not have broken. When I ordered another pair, one of them came completely shattered. How it broke when it was so well packaged I don't know. I'm thinking it was packaged broken. Anyway I didn't go through the hassle of reporting it and trying to get a replacement. Thus the 3 star rating."

Christine K. Cornett-McVay,"Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the cups,"The board is rather flimsy on this. The wood flexes too easily and you‚Äôll want to grip it with two hands during transport. Also, the glass indentation is so shallow that it barely holds the cups in place at all. On the plus side, the glasses are nice and can hold liquid great. They also clean up easily. The glasses also have a thick enough bottom to sit balanced. I honestly will probably end up tossing the board in the garbage and just using the glasses."

Midori,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2023",3.0 out of 5 stars,Fun conversational wine glass but not forever use...,I've purchase a pair from one of those big discount stores and really like it as the serving size was perfect and most importantly kept my beverage chilled. I searched online and found deals on Amazon so I got a few sets to keep in my freezer for myself and guest. It is a cool adult beverage glass and it feels good in your hand. After a few months the plastic started separating around the seams of the cup and I noticed the liquid that kept the cup cold was leaking out. A few of the cups exploded in my freezer and would even crack while using it to drink. Maybe because of the seal and outside pressure? I wished this lasted and was safe to use but eventually I had to throw all my neat wine glasses away.

I do not expect them to last forever but I wish they hadn‚Äôt value engineered them. These were the perfect wine glasses for me because I like my champagne really cold. I have 3 in the freezer and I still reach for the old one first and use it.  If I hadn‚Äôt had the older model I probably would give this 5 stars, but I was spoiled by only needing to use one glass for an evening and with the new ones I require 2 to keep the wine chilled well.

We had to purchase separate inside reinforcement seals for the straw and sip slot and straw caps to cover up the exposed straw. I also purchased boots to cut down on the bottom wear and tear. I like the overall model of it, but it's way heavier than my other high end 40oz. Overrated!"
dia,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Just like any other cup,"I will be honest; this cup is just like any other cup. It's like an Owala or a Yeti cup. The downside of it is it is so heavy to carry. (if you have metacarpal problems, then I would say no to it for the 40oz) It does keep water cool, but so does the Yeti and Owala. If you want to get the Stanley because it's cute, then, by all means, go ahead, but if you want a cup to keep drinks cool and you want to save some money, then get an alternative."

Mary Ann Acone,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2024",3.0 out of 5 stars,Be careful!!!,I bought the 64 oz Stanley and loved it!  I drink a lot of water.  My meds cause dry mouth.  Then after a week or two I had terrible shoulder pain.  I was confused until I realized lifting the water bottle full is causing injury!  I've stopped using it until the soreness goes away.  Then I guess I can use it when I start lifting weights.  I feel like a warning is appropriate.

Stanley offered no support, they basically told me it was my fault and that they wouldn't help me.  They offer a ""lifetime warranty"" but it's not realllllllly a lifetime warranty because they will use any excuse to not help you.  A local Facebook group was actually helpful and told me to pour boiling water on this which, miraculously, got rid of the issue on the finish.  I still don't know how, but Stanley support could have at least suggested this and they did not.  So... cups are great, support isn't, don't put them in the dishwasher if you care about the finish.

I contacted the manufacturer, sent them pictures they requested with replacements promised.  Then I was notified that quality control claimed the one with all the water was not their product.  It definitely was but they only replaced the 2 short ones and 1 tall one. I resent pictures to show the markings were identical with their new replacement but I never heard back again.

We finally got these 16oz versions to match and there is everything we loved about the 12oz EXCEPT 6 of the 8 have very rough portions that pinch and annoy our lips if we drink from that portion.  We have to find the smoothest part to drink from on these 6.  We cannot simply return these as we had confidence in the company so we unpacked these, put our old 16oz glasses and tossed them out while we cleaned the new ones.  As I first started drying the glasses after washing I discovered the rough edges around the rim, where they seal it.  Again, none of the 12oz we got in 2018 have this challenge, they're all smooth to this day.  So, this may just be an unlucky couple of boxes that got through QC or the company's QC has gone down.  Not sure which and we are not going to buy another box to find out...these are not cheap and the investment is one we made gladly and now are simply frustrated with.  I hope it is just a couple of boxes.  This would have been a 5 star review, we like these a lot.  But, when 6 of 8 are rough to the lips every time you take a sip the review score drops."

I was not looking for a bargain when I bought but clear and a certain size for drinks for meals especially during summer when everything sweats.They now look terrible, but are easy to hold, the correct size and safe for using out on the deck for meals.I would not recommend to a friend."

That may be true, but the quality, of the set I received, was not that great.  Where the plastic molding process joins the top ring to the bottom has protruding edges to the point I had to sand mine down.  To be honest, the set I received isn't any better than I could have picked up at a discount store for less than half the price."

back to nature,"Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2018",3.0 out of 5 stars,Made in the USA,"The tumblers are nice, 3 stars because they have a rough nick along the edge of one and on the inside of one the seal is a little questionable,  so I hope the insulating seal will remain good.  The good thing is that they have a warranty.  A nice note came with them that said to call within a certain time with my phone number and name, I would get a callback  and I would receive a gift from Homestead just for ordering.  I called immediately but never got the return call. I thought they were pretty expensive for 16 oz but I was in need of some new ones and could not find any locally and I wanted USA made. It would have been better  if the labels would peel off without leaving a residue that is going to be hard to get off."

Karl,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2013",3.0 out of 5 stars,"2 glasses broken, otherwise fine","I just received the glasses and 2 of them were completely shattered. Frankly, the only surprising thing was the fact that all of the glasses weren't broken - there was absolutely no padding in the box, just one of those flimsy cardboard dividers between the glasses. Luckily it's a set of 12, and the glasses that did survive seem relatively sturdy, so as long as you aren't attached to having exactly 12 glasses then this is a good deal."

There is nothing delicate about it. Except for its atractive shape, it feels just like a jelly glass- thick and much too heavy!  I realize thin glass can be more breakable; however, it doesn't have to be, and therefore a better balance between delicate and heavy-handed needs to achieved."

Recently we destroyed the last of our glassware by accident and it was time to buy a new set for my mother on mother's day.These glasses we're perfect,  it matched our already existing ware and looked cleverly designed. However,  the problems became very apparent on the first day when we decided to wash them.  That was when the first glass broke.  Disappointed,  we threw the glass away and went on with our day.  After all we still had many good glasses left.  However,  from mothers day to today we have lost 4 glasses.In fact,  I lost another glass about 2 minutes ago when I was softly tapping the side of the glass with a spoon,  ""after stirring a mixed drink"" the glass shattered.I am very disappointed with this product...  They are beautiful pieces of glassware that seem to break with just a touch.Do not buy if you plan to use as normal day to day glassware"

When I opened it to put more dishes in, one of the glasses had broken with glass all over in the dishwasher.  This is the first time I have had a glass break that I didn't drop off the counter.  For a everyday glass they should use a stronger type of glass.Also, one glass came with a bubble on the side, but a little steel wool smoothed the sharp edge."

Another had some swirling that occurred in the formation and is pretty noticeable (1st pic).  Can't comment on the durability, but 1/4 of this set should have been deemed rejects when manufactured."

I had actually cut my wrist open because there was a large part of the glass' base missing (broken) which I didn't see when opening and handling my new glasses. At first I thought that this blemish had to do with bad packaging - but when I looked at all the other glasses (4 total) EVERY single one had small (but significant) defects - a chip or broken part of some kind, mainly around the lips, where people put their lips on! It looks so bad that I now think they had left the manufacturing facility like that, and did not even receive these blemishes during the shipment process. I'm not sure, but when it comes down to it, this is what you get: Four broken margarita glasses, which your guests (whom you serve) may cut their lips or their wrists open on. Two stars might have been too nice. Once again, not entirely sure if it has to do with quality control or packaging, but the end product is the same."

In less than 2 weeks, 3 of the small tumblers had chips on the lip of the glass that quickly spread and we had to throw them away.  Then, one of the large tumblers cracked and it had to be thrown away, too. So, I don't recommend these glasses if you are using them for a family.  Maybe they'd hold up for years with proper usage but given how quickly ours cracked, they may just be too delicate for long-term usage."

Tamara,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,So much breakage,"I loved these glasses at first. They are comfortable to hold, and look very nice. But the short glasses break SO easily. I don‚Äôt seem to have that problem with the tall glasses, but we‚Äôve already broken 5 of the short glasses (and not by dropping them- just placing them in the dishwasher and barely tapping them against another dish by accident). In comparison, during the same time frame, we haven‚Äôt broken any other dishes or glasses."

Crappy Coffee Maker,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Crack Easily,"I bought these glasses for the style at a reasonable cost, and was very happy with them when they arrived. The thick base and share are attractive, and make the glass comfortable to hold. I especially like the rocks glasses, but within the first week, three of them cracked while being cleaned in the dishwasher. It didn't occur to me they wouldn't be ""dishwasher safe"", and if not, they're kind of impractical. So far, all of the coolers have survived. I assume the remaining five rocks glasses are in danger, and I'll just replace them with something else as they continue to dwindle."

The Happy Shooper,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty color but the glass is not thick enough, thin glass","I bought these glasses because of the color, they were shipped by Libbey, I got them fast either way.  The ""Hold Me"" part is thin, the ""Substantial Base"" is thick. I like them but I'm afraid they will brake somehow because of the thin part. It doesn't come with the care instructions but you can visit a site Libbey sends on paper in the package. I will recommend for these glasses to wash them by hand if you want the to last longer. I have some Tumblers not from the same brand but with the same thin glass and they easy to brake if I don't wash them by hand, also the glass in the dishwasher makes the glass corroded. They were shipped with care. I like Libbey's glasses, I have had other type of glasses and they durable, I never had these before but I know I will have to be very careful with them. Not too easy too hold if you don't hold them from the bottom/base. I hope Libbey to read this review and make the glasses thick because the color is pretty. They didn't come in a Libbey's box but I searched that Libbey's glasses are made in the USA."

Jax,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work any better than a glass of ice,"There are two big problems with these. One is that there's not enough gel in the walls to reach the top of the cup when frozen. This means that the part of the liquid you're drinking from isn't actually being chilled if the cup is full. The other is the large opening. Because the walls are what is keeping the drink cold, the large open top allows a lot of heat transfer to occur which warms your drink fast. Precisely calibrating the amount of gel to fill the whole cup when frozen and fitting a lid on top would drastically improve this product."

Cynthia,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,So so,"They seem to hold up fine. The black grip makes them comfortable to hold.  But they don‚Äôt really seem to keep the drink particularly cold (used well frozen from the freezer). As a few other people have pointed out, the gel does not fill the whole space between the layers, and that makes the appearance a bit off, and leaves about 1/3 to 1/2 of the glass without chilling.They don‚Äôt seem to keep a beverage any cooler then a frozen pint glass. Will be giving to goodwill. Really wanted to like these."

JASON D.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"The frosty area appears to contain the freezing gel, approximately 30% of the total internal space.The gel provides a small substitution for ice, maybe 2 ice cubes at most! The cold is bold for 10 seconds and melts rapidly! I had an Arizona Cardinals gel cup in the 90‚Äôs. It was 90% full of gel. It would turn a 12oz soda into slush and sustain it for the duration of your drink without reverting back to a liquid!I guess I will have to continue my search!"

Doctor Yoda,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2020",2.0 out of 5 stars,Gel only 50% filled up,"It puzzled me that the gel in this beer glass was only 50% filled up leaving a lot of void (that presumably does not do an as good job keeping it cold). At first I thought it would expand after freezing to fill up the remaining space, but no it did not and still left a big chunk of void. This does not maximize its ability to keep my drink cold and I don‚Äôt understand the rationale to skimp on a bit more gel material for a $15 glass.Because of the void the glass also looks weird as if it was broken or leaking; that was not an issue to me but might be for others."

I only had two glasses left from the last set I bought (not these), so I needed them quick.  What I didn‚Äôt expect would be the terrible look and quality of these glasses.  When I held them, they had a really nice feel to them and I was reasonably pleased with the weight.  At first glance, I was holding a really nice piece of glassware.  After unpacking a few of them, what I saw had me so disgusted and disappointed.  The glasses had bubbles and blemishes all over, and the bottoms of the short glasses were at an angle.  This causes the glasses to be slightly off balance, but the look is really off-putting.  I thought, for a brief moment, that it was just one of the 3 boxes that I bought, however, much to my chagrin, it was every-single glass.  I must return them now, which will be a huge pain, because the boxes are really heavy.

Granted, I have children so things get broken and chipped but the rate at which these are breaking compared with my old glasses shows me these are just not tough enough to stand up to daily family use.  I have some old glasses from my wedding back in 2001 that have slowly broken over the years.  Those glasses were just some inexpensive set from Target but they were FAR more sturdy than these glasses.  I still have 3 glasses from the 12 originals from 2001.  But of the 12 Luigi Bormioli Michelangelo glasses I received 10 months ago, only 6 remain and one of those is chipped!  Nope, certainly not for me!"
Beatrice Izzey,"Reviewed in the United States on January 14, 2009",2.0 out of 5 stars,badly balanced,"These glasses look cool.  But they are weirdly balanced in weight from top to bottom - the bottom is too heavy, and the top is too thin delicate and light.  All four broke in the three months we have had them.  We handwash glasses too, we don't use a dishwasher.  We were disappointed.  Perhaps engineering wise, it's impossible to have  a large iced tea glass that is not plastic. Perhaps the message is, we have to use ugly plastic tumblers."

However, we loaded a few into the dishwasher and upon taking them out many had warped. We threw those out, but hand washed the rest.I love the idea of stemless glasses because they don't tip over as easily. The size of these glasses were also perfect for smaller hands.

After contacting Libbey directly they were nice enough to send me some replacement cases of glasses which too had many defective glasses. When I contacted them AGAIN telling them that even the replacement glasses had defects in most of them I was told to only purchase their glasses through a 'b2b' vendor and not Amazon as the quality control thru Amazon was not the same.

I don‚Äôt think they are dishwasher safe but they said they are?? I mean it looks funky but still works. The bottoms are also getting weird too so I‚Äôm sure it holds less liquid (btw I only use cold liquid like water in them, it must be the dishwasher doing it)"
Axxul,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Walls too thin, break too easily","I bought 2 boxes of these 8 months ago because they looked modern and minimalist which is what I wanted however  we only have 4 of the tall glasses eft because the walls are so thin and they keep breaking of cracking.  Most of them have come out cracked or break in the dishwasher, I had never had this happen with other glasses before. We've had the short glasses break too but not as many as the tall."
BB,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,Quite fragile and some arrived defective,"Glasses look very nice and are a solid pick at first glance, but beware. They are quite thin, which is nice for drinking but makes them very fragile. I have had two glasses break in a month, one of which broke as it leaned over on another glass while I was removing it from the dishwasher. Two of the bases on the glasses I recieved were also defective, with a big lump of glass missing on the inside surface of the cup. At the price they were at this can be considered tolerable but for the full retail value you can certainly do better."
M. Lurie,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,Glass broke during its first trip through the dishwasher,"One of the rocks glasses in this set broke on its first trip through the dishwasher.  It was not packed tightly, and it was in the top rack. I'm not sure what happened.  I hope this is not a sign of things to come.We received the glasses about 3 weeks ago, so I could return the entire set.  However, that seems like a huge hassle for one broken glass out of 24.  I've contacted Libbey to see if they will replace the single glass and will follow up with their response."

However, the glasses just keep cracking,breaking, or chipping. In 2 months, I‚Äôve thrown away 5 cups. I‚Äôm disappointed that they aren‚Äôt more sturdy and durable. Probably won‚Äôt buy again.Edit to add, I‚Äôve now thrown away 2 additional cups.  One broke just getting washed in the dishwasher.  At this rate, the set I have won‚Äôt last until the end of the year."
JH,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,Way too Fragile,"Bought these for Christmas.  It's now April and I've broken 5 of the larger glasses.  If you even gently lay a pot or stack more than 2 plates on top of one of these in the sink...they break.  If you barely tap them...they break.  If your dishes shift in the sink from filling up with water...they break.  Do not buy these if you have kids.  Do not buy these if you are even moderately rough with your glassware.  They look nice and if you  only have adults living in your house who never stack dishes in the sink...they might survive.  Otherwise, buy yourself some bar glasses or anything else with thicker glass than these.  They are super thinwalled and very fragile.  Enjoy!"

However, many years ago I bought a set of Libbey glasses much like these. They lasted for years. When I bought this set I was disappointed to find that these are made of much lighter weight glass. One of the glasses chipped and cracked the first time I used it. Very disappointing. The old set only chipped or cracked when they were dropped by the kids on the ceramic tile floor."
Sonya M. Miller,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2023",2.0 out of 5 stars,Breaks very easily,I purchased these to replace a set of glasses I had for about 10 years.

This is not a water problem as our water is softened and our other glasses are not experiencing this issues.Sturdiness:  of the 8 small glasses only 3 remain.  They tend to be much thinner and easily damaged.  I thought the thinner tall glasses might be a problem but it turns out it‚Äôs the short ones.

One of the shorter glasses split along the hairline as I was washing it.  The other 2 are usable but I notice the hairline fracture is growing imperceptibly longer.  I have purchased these Libbey glass sets in the past and have never had this problem.  I can only attribute it to a defect in the composition of the glass in this batch.

AverageJoe,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect in appearance, horrible in strength","First up, I know these are glass and glass is fragile.  That said, these glasses are perhaps the weakest glasses we've ever owned.  It's a shame too.  Their size and weight is perfect for a glass.  However, these glasses are so fragile that the slightest dings or bumps in the dishwasher, sink, etc. cause them to crack or break apart.  We're not slamming these things around and we're not being rough in handling them.  However, we've lost over half the set in bumps that caused breaks and the majority of our dishes around it are plastic plates and bowls.  They're mainly bumping into each other.Bottom line: We do NOT recommend this set of glasses.  Get something thicker and sturdier."

This mostly happens after coming out of the dishwasher which makes me question their resiliency with respect to washing temperatures.Most of the broken glasses were the tumblers, however, there we a couple of the rocks glasses that broke as well. I had an Ikea set previously (which was very similar in design) that lasted years without such problems so I'm now looking for a similar looking set that has better durability."

Martin - Boston,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,Disposable glassware -- Is that what you want?,"[Here's an update of my comments below.  The glasses are breaking less often now.  That's because there are fewer of them left unbroken to break.  Down to two or three glasses left.  They frequently break when placed in the dishwasher; some break when being removed from the dishwasher.  So far none have broken just when sitting on the counter in an empty room.]These are attractive glasses.  Problem is they break easily.  I've had them for less than one month. So far, half of the larger size glasses have broken.  Some have broken when I put them in the dish washer; some when I've taken them out.  The good news is none of the smaller glasses have broken yet.  The bad news is I haven't yet used any of the smaller glasses.  Some are in the cabinet untouched; others are still in the box.  So, evidently the key to long life for this glassware is to keep it in the box unused.  It's not expensive, so if you think of these as much like disposable plastic drinking glasses,  you'll do fine.  I note though that in my experience, disposable plastic drinking glasses are much sturdier."

Shidarin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,Huge decline in quality,"I've had a set of Libbey glasses of the same type for over 5 years. A few of them broke eventually, so it became time to seek out replacements but I loved the style. I was so excited when I could buy the exact same glasses! But other reviews are right- quality has gone downhill and these are shoddy.First up, weight. The numbers might not look like much, but the difference is huge. The tall glass now feels incredibly fragile and cheap.Old tall glass weight: 13.7 ozNew tall glass weight: 10.2 ozOld short glass weight: 11.2 ozNew short glass weight: 9.9 ozThe inside of the new glasses are also incredibly tilted on the bottom! While this doesn't impact the functionality (it's a glass.. it holds liquids) it looks bad, and speaks to the install manufacturing quality. I don't expect these to be sturdy long term, and one of the short glasses broke in transit (but I just needed the tall glasses, so no biggie).The included pictures show the new glasses with tilted bottoms on the left, old glasses on the right.I would have paid more to get glasses of the same quality as my old set. Guess I should try something else."
NBE,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not great quality,"I received these as a Christmas gift and I am not impressed.

I have realized these will not last me too long like my previous glasses. I guess this is one of those instances where you get what you pay for. Also, the mouth of these on the tall ones are not big enough to have ice fall into them from the fridge's ice machine."

Their reply was that it took up to 45 days and to check my tracking to see when they received them and count days from there. We'll, 50 or so days past without hearing anything, so I reached out again and was told it could take up to 60 days and that same look at my tracking thing. Today Nov.24 has been a week or so over the 60 days, so I reached out again and now am told it can take up to 90 days and that same check my tracking thing. This either boils down to, 1.

First off it looks great, upon using I found there was an extra protruding lip around the top that was different from the earlier versions I had, but really what let me down were the four protrusions from the plastic molding process that were left over from production.

Moore-Al,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2019",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not Like The Tervis Cups I Know And Love,"I am a Tervis devotee. I got rid of all my glassware and now use only Tervis 16oz tumblers at home. They are just amazing! They are not just leakproof and sweat proof, they also insulate brilliantly.But I‚Äôm disappointed to report that this 24oz tumbler was nothing at all like the Tervis tumblers I have grown to love. It was so preposterously inferior, in fact, that I asked Amazon for a refund. It was sweat proof and leakproof but there was no insulation at all. To illustrate the difference I will give two examples:The insulation on my 16oz Tervis tumblers is phenomenal. Many times and in all seasons I have set one of my 16oz Tervis tumblers full of ice next to my bed at night (with no lid) and woke up in the morning to find ice cold water with chunks of ice still floating in it. I‚Äôve also left a cup full of ice in a hot car in the summer, locked it up and gone shopping for an hour, and still had lots of ice left in the cup when I returned.By comparison, while it did not leak or sweat, there was essentially no insulation in this 24oz Tervis tumbler. Even the lid didn‚Äôt help. I filled the 24oz Tervis tumbler with ice and set it by the bed while I was reading and within a couple of hours all the ice was melted and the water was only slightly cool. This happened time and time again. I couldn‚Äôt believe this cup was made by Tervis because it sure didn‚Äôt perform like the Tervis products I know. I‚Äôd planned to show it off to my grandchildren, who use Yeti products, but I was too embarrassed by its poor performance."

Then, one of the large tumblers cracked and it had to be thrown away, too. So, I don't recommend these glasses if you are using them for a family.

Tamara,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,So much breakage,"I loved these glasses at first. They are comfortable to hold, and look very nice. But the short glasses break SO easily. I don‚Äôt seem to have that problem with the tall glasses, but we‚Äôve already broken 5 of the short glasses (and not by dropping them- just placing them in the dishwasher and barely tapping them against another dish by accident). In comparison, during the same time frame, we haven‚Äôt broken any other dishes or glasses."

J. Walker,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2022",2.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for a dishwasher,Every glass in the set has a deep dimple in the bottom of it.

Crappy Coffee Maker,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Crack Easily,"I bought these glasses for the style at a reasonable cost, and was very happy with them when they arrived. The thick base and share are attractive, and make the glass comfortable to hold. I especially like the rocks glasses, but within the first week, three of them cracked while being cleaned in the dishwasher. It didn't occur to me they wouldn't be ""dishwasher safe"", and if not, they're kind of impractical. So far, all of the coolers have survived. I assume the remaining five rocks glasses are in danger, and I'll just replace them with something else as they continue to dwindle."

The Happy Shooper,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty color but the glass is not thick enough, thin glass","I bought these glasses because of the color, they were shipped by Libbey, I got them fast either way.  The ""Hold Me"" part is thin, the ""Substantial Base"" is thick. I like them but I'm afraid they will brake somehow because of the thin part. It doesn't come with the care instructions but you can visit a site Libbey sends on paper in the package. I will recommend for these glasses to wash them by hand if you want the to last longer. I have some Tumblers not from the same brand but with the same thin glass and they easy to brake if I don't wash them by hand, also the glass in the dishwasher makes the glass corroded. They were shipped with care. I like Libbey's glasses, I have had other type of glasses and they durable, I never had these before but I know I will have to be very careful with them. Not too easy too hold if you don't hold them from the bottom/base. I hope Libbey to read this review and make the glasses thick because the color is pretty. They didn't come in a Libbey's box but I searched that Libbey's glasses are made in the USA."

I had actually cut my wrist open because there was a large part of the glass' base missing (broken) which I didn't see when opening and handling my new glasses. At first I thought that this blemish had to do with bad packaging - but when I looked at all the other glasses (4 total) EVERY single one had small (but significant) defects - a chip or broken part of some kind, mainly around the lips, where people put their lips on! It looks so bad that I now think they had left the manufacturing facility like that, and did not even receive these blemishes during the shipment process. I'm not sure, but when it comes down to it, this is what you get: Four broken margarita glasses, which your guests (whom you serve) may cut their lips or their wrists open on. Two stars might have been too nice. Once again, not entirely sure if it has to do with quality control or packaging, but the end product is the same."

The blue swirl blistered on the outside of the glass (see picture) and I don't feel comfortable using it because it is obviously weakened in this area and I'm afraid it might break while I'm drinking from it. I liked the blue swirl appearance and paid extra for it. Otherwise these are not exceptional glasses in any way.Also, I didn't see any ready and convenient way to possibly have the glass replaced. Wonder why?I bought 4 sets of these glasses; different styles but they all match. I was going to use them for when I had guests over but now they will just become everyday glasses till they all end up in the trash."

I was told I needed to return the entire set and request a new one. This is a great deal of unnecessary work and delay in the ability to use any of the set and risks receiving another damaged item. The issue is therefore unresolved and I will never order from this company again. I will return this set for a refund and find a company that is more customer service oriented.

There is nothing delicate about it. Except for its atractive shape, it feels just like a jelly glass- thick and much too heavy!  I realize thin glass can be more breakable; however, it doesn't have to be, and therefore a better balance between delicate and heavy-handed needs to achieved."

The second, I opened the cupboard and was sitting there with a big chunk out of it. I don't get it. These are beautiful glasses, but I doubt we'll continue using them due to the lack of durability.

evan owen nagy,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful but terrible durability,"Some of the glasses that I family had owned have been broken by time.  Recently we destroyed the last of our glassware by accident and it was time to buy a new set for my mother on mother's day.These glasses we're perfect,  it matched our already existing ware and looked cleverly designed. However,  the problems became very apparent on the first day when we decided to wash them.  That was when the first glass broke.  Disappointed,  we threw the glass away and went on with our day.  After all we still had many good glasses left.  However,  from mothers day to today we have lost 4 glasses.In fact,  I lost another glass about 2 minutes ago when I was softly tapping the side of the glass with a spoon,  ""after stirring a mixed drink"" the glass shattered.I am very disappointed with this product...  They are beautiful pieces of glassware that seem to break with just a touch.Do not buy if you plan to use as normal day to day glassware"
Gregg Stephens,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2021",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful and comfortable, but VERY brittle","I was skeptical of the reviews that the glasses broke easy, accidents happen.  After about a week, I had put some in the dishwasher and they tipped when I closed the door.  When I opened it to put more dishes in, one of the glasses had broken with glass all over in the dishwasher.  This is the first time I have had a glass break that I didn't drop off the counter.  For a everyday glass they should use a stronger type of glass.Also, one glass came with a bubble on the side, but a little steel wool smoothed the sharp edge."

So I was excited to see these beautiful replacements - 8 each of 2 sizes - that would match our dishes. Make that 15 total since one small glass was destroyed in the shipping. Three months later, 6 more juice glasses have broken, and ridiculously easily. They break when we are placing them in the dishwasher. They break when we are taking them out. One split down the side when my daughter placed it gently on the countertop. Another broke when it barely touched a second glass. Buyer beware - they‚Äôre pretty but not as sturdy as they look.

After contacting Libbey directly they were nice enough to send me some replacement cases of glasses which too had many defective glasses. When I contacted them AGAIN telling them that even the replacement glasses had defects in most of them I was told to only purchase their glasses through a 'b2b' vendor and not Amazon as the quality control thru Amazon was not the same. So I have been highly disappointed that not only is their quality control inconsistent, but I had to also scramble to get replacement glasses from different other vendors to fulfill my customer orders.

Barnard,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020",2.0 out of 5 stars,The glasses freezes beer!,"The glass does keep beer cold, so cold it freezes a pretty good amount to the glass where the cold packs/hand holder are.  It didn't even thaw out after the beer was gone for about 15 minutes.  It makes for a nasty flat couple of sips at the end.  If drinking an expensive beer it totally wastes about 2 oz.They are very difficult to take apart to wash well either.I will be returning these to Amazon."
Stone Dog,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020",2.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, back to the drawing board...","I couldn't tell that they kept the beverage any colder over time than any other tumbler. I just couldn't tell any difference. The rubber material around the lower region of the glasses helped to hold frozen glasses, but didn't feel right. Some places, the felt soft and others hard, like it was a little lumpy. I felt all it did was lessen the capacity of the glasses to have the rubber inserts.So, I didn't think these were worthwhile."

Nope! As much as i would have loved to use these, and they truly look fantastic, I know these could have been made with other BPA-free materials. I know that since BPA is only an issue for plastic leaching into the liquid with heat, these would technically work for cold drinks, however it still a bit discouraging to see a sticker that claims your item is known to cause cancer."

I recommend either spending a bit more for a better brand of glasses (especially if you are drinking $50+ whiskey!).I recommend Taylor'd Milestones, Waterford, or Schott Zwiesel Tritan (which we have for snifters - but they also make rocks glasses).

Since I purchased them a little over a month ago, 3 of the 8 taller glasses broke. Two developed cracks, which I attributed to accidents in the dishwasher. Okay, maybe that was my fault. However, the third one broke while I was dispensing ice into it from the refrigerator. An ice cube somehow managed to completely shatter the top of the glass. That should NEVER happen. I do not like writing negative reviews, but these are glasses to avoid."

Not one single glass. There are 7 tall glasses left.We have kids, yes. No one is that violent with a glass of water. Only two or three broke from an accident. All the rest broke while gently putting away from the dishwasher or were removed from the dishwasher with cracks.I read reviews prior to purchasing and these had a high rating. I don‚Äôt mind replacing things every few years because they were used and loved and broke down but this is pretty ridiculous..I‚Äôm disappointed but hopefully this helps someone else decide if they want to purchase with a high chance of these needing to be replaced in a couple years."

A week later I was doing the dishes and I was washing the dishes and the same thing happened to me where the glass just shattered for no reason in my hand and a tall glass sliced my thumb open.  These cuts are very deep and were emergency room worthy. I have very tiny hands.  So they break very easily.  We are extremely disappointed in this glasses and had to buy a different set so no one else has this issue with them.  They are very dangerous.

However, within 6 months, every large glass is broke.  They are thin and not durable.  These are not every day glasses and should not be put i dishwasher.  Also, the original company I bought these from is ""out of Business"" and not on amazon anymore.  Probably because glasses suck in quality.If you wan these to sit around and look cool, but 'em.  If you want everyday glasses.  Plus the nefarious company went out of business so as not to address quality issues.  SO dont expect this company to stand behind these glasses either"

Salvador Jane,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,They break with even the slight end tap.,"These glasses are beautiful.  The problem is that I ordered three cases of them for Thanksgiving and when I opened just one of the cases, three glasses were broken.  Then, Thanksgiving day, two more were broken.  And just now, one more broke in the dishwasher.  The glass is so thin that they just shatter with the slightest touch.  We went ahead and tossed the remaining glasses from all the boxes because they're not worth it.  Spend a little extra and buy glasses that are more durable.  So disappointed!"
PDL,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Durable these are not.,"Don't get me wrong, these glasses are elegant and otherwise aesthetically pleasing. They sit nicely in the hand, and perform the role of being a liquid-delivery vessel with style.But...they're fragile as a bee's wings. We've had four out of eight break over the past year. One broke being placed into the dishwasher (the side clinked against the dishwasher tray and shattered). Another broke somehow during a normal dishwasher cycle (on the top shelf, placed correctly). The third broke clinking against another glass (think ""cheers"" level clinking, not smashing together at all). The fourth broke after being tipped over on a table, which I guess makes sense, but given the other three breakages, it's worth including here.We had these on our registry because my partner's parents had Libbey glasses of a similar style that have lasted for decades. These didn't live up to our expectations at all. I suppose that's to be expected given the price, but I'm still giving it one star because the description claims they are durable. Durable glasses shouldn't break this easily."
CJ,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Cracked in dishwasher,"I have had these for less than two weeks.  After the second wash, half of them cracked in the dishwasher.  Some cracked at the base, which radiated up the side of the glass.  Others cracked only on the side.

skichiknh,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,So Easy to Break!!,"I really wanted to like these. They look great, and have a wonderful weight to them. However, they are incredibly thin at the top and break at nothing. I ordered 24 originally, and in less than a year, we are down to less than 10. They are difficult to handwash (unless you have tiny hands), and break at the slightest touch to anything. Almost literally anything. Normally I would chock up breaks to user-error, but not at this rate. Save yourself frustration and wasted money (not only that spent on these glasses, but also on Band-Aids) and look for a sturdier product."

Maria,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,DEFECTIVE!  Factory rejects??? No quality control? BEWARE - DO NOT BUY!!!,"8 out of 8 of these boxed and sealed glasses were defective...  I've used Libbey Gibraltar glasses for years which have become opalized from dishwasher use, so I ordered these to replace them.  I have never seen anything in stores as low quality as this! Almost every glass had what looked like paint brush strokes seen horizontally along the sides as if someone took an actual paint brush around the perimeter while the glass was still hot during production.  Two glasses had what looked like paint brush strokes so bad that it looked like there was  a solid line through the middle of the two glasses.  Several of the bottoms inside were not flat.  Some had bubbles in the glass itself.  Edges up the sides of the glass were not straight in some areas and indentations can be seen.  These would have been absolutely beautiful glasses if they weren't defective!  Where is the quality control???  This was absolute garbage.  Lately, it seems real sketchy with quality of items received that have been ordered off of Amazon...  Super disappointed and frustrated. Returned with no issues, but unable to add photographs of defects and keep getting message stating ""unable to process..."""

Anne,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,These will break eventually with regular wear and usage,I do not usually write reviews but I am disappointed in the longevity of this item. We received a little over a year ago. We use the taller glasses regularly and out of a set of 8 only 4 remain usable. We have not dropped the glasses and either hand wash or wash in dishwasher. They all start with a chip and then progress to a crack in the glass so they have been thrown out. I do not think that there is anything that the company or Amazon will do because it is beyond the 30 day window. If I would have known that these glasses were not durable than I would have never bought. And I am aggravated with Amazon return policy

I've had a similar set of Ikea glasses that have not chipped in the dishwasher in over 5 years. I'm assuming this means that I'll have a bunch of worthless, chipped glasses on my hands in under a year. So, huge waste of money for someone on as tight a budget as I am. Am returning despite the hassle of repacking a bunch of apparently overly fragile glass. Really fun"
Backslash,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,Shockingly poor quality,"I bought a set that looked similar at a big box store decades ago and bought this hoping to fill in the gaps of glasses broken over the years. At first I was thrilled: design is almost a perfect match, aside from the base being inexplicably slightly thicker. Then I noticed the lip.It's impossible to see in the glamor shots, but the lips of these are...bad. Wobbly and inconsistent like the machine that made them was drunk. There's supposed to be a raised ridge around the edge, and this ridge is wildly inconsistent: sometimes full height, sometimes half, sometimes flush with the glass. The remaining glasses in the set I was trying to replace have none of these issues. I'd understand if it was one odd duck out, but ALL the new glasses have this issue. I also felt some rough spurs of glass one the rims when examining them, which...yikes. Combine this with the reports of these easily and unexpectedly breaking (I've had, and dishwashingmachine'd the old set for years without issue) and it's clear the quality control on these is garbage. May try a replacement set to see if I get lucky, but otherwise, no joy."

So if you plan on being a human and drinking from the glasses you purchased because you're an adult and you want real glasses to drink from, these are not the ones."

Four have already broken (Two in the dishwasher, one in the sink, and just found another in the cabinet with a huge crack). I could tell the glass was very thin from the moment I took them out of the box and should have sent them back. The light weight and narrow base make them easy to tip over. Our last set of glasses were very durable and weighty, and we had them for several years. These were very disappointing and after less than three months we'll need to buy new glasses."

Product Inspector,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing Performance and Poor Quality,"I'm sorry to say that my experience with the Host Freeze Beer Glasses has not been very positive. While the glasses are marketed as a convenient and innovative way to keep beer cold, they fall short in several areas.Price: The Host Freeze Beer Glasses are priced at a premium, but unfortunately, the product's performance does not justify the cost.Delivery Speed: Shipping was fast, but the glasses arrived with a few cracks and chips, suggesting poor quality control during manufacturing or shipping.Product Quality: The quality of the glasses is disappointing, with flimsy plastic that easily cracks or breaks with regular use. The double wall and freezer gel features do not work as advertised, as the glasses do not keep beer cold for very long and the gel can leak out and make a mess. Additionally, the glasses are smaller than expected, making them impractical for larger portions or thicker beer.Comparison to Similar Product: Compared to other beer glasses with cooling features, this product falls short in terms of durability and performance.Seller's Response Times: The seller was unresponsive to inquiries and did not offer any assistance with the quality issues or shipping damages.Ease of Use: While the glasses are easy to use and clean, their poor quality and lack of performance make them not worth the investment.Conclusion: Overall, I would not recommend the Host Freeze Beer Glasses, as the quality and performance do not meet expectations. There are better and more reliable options on the market that are worth considering."

Perfectly Imperfect,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the box it was sent in.,"I was thrilled reading the reviews about a double wall plastic glass that was dishwasher and freezer safe. This was complete mis advertised. The cups arrived late, so I was hesitant I would receive them. Once they came I immediately put them in the dishwasher on the top rack and used the quick wash setting. That was all it took to melt the cups and create a mess in my dishwasher. The gel filler came out of the cups as they melted and the plastic hardened on the bottom of my dishwasher resulting in a lengthy project of trying to remove it. Do not buy if you have any inkling of using these in the dishwasher. Save yourself the day and a headache and think twice about this purchase."

I put them in the freezer in the upright position not seeing the tiny sticker on the cup that said to put them upside down.  I'm not a germaphobe but that means having the rim of the cup where your lips are supposed to go, sitting on the freezer floor, which probably isn't the cleanest surface in the world.  Both cups deformed badly so that they are now ovals not round like a cup is supposed to be.  This is before I actually put any kind of liquid in it so have no idea how well they keep drinks cold.  Great concept, badly implemented."

Making beer colder means making it not taste like anything. The colder a bad beer is, the less you can taste it. Most beers that would taste better in this glass are beers that are cheap, canned and don‚Äôt taste good requiring them to be served ice cold. When beer warms up 45-50 degrees that‚Äôs when you can taste them.  Buy an Rtic or Yeti if you like drinking bad, cheap, cold canned beer."

The attached pictures are from 2 seperate incidents and as you can see, I was very lucky both times that the very  sharp bottoms did not cut me.  The first time it happened I contacted them and was told it was my fault because I shocked the glass by using it right from the dishwasher. When I told them I didn't own a dishwasher and was just having a glass of ice water, they still insited that I shocked the glass and that is why it broke.  The second time it happened, I reached out to them and this time they didn't even bother to repsond to me.  No acknowledgement, no apology, no replacement, no refund, nothing, just crickets.

They break without being dropped, bumped or even touched.We‚Äôve never owned more fragile drinking glasses. Ever. Nearly every time we take them out of the dishwasher one has a new crack or a missing piece. Yesterday, my son nearly sliced his hand open when reaching into the cupboard for a glass‚Äîluckily he noticed a chunk had fallen off and he didn‚Äôt touch it. (Not the first time this has happened, either, but it was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back and finally compelled me to write my first negative review of a product.)These things are deadly.However, if  you enjoy regularly discovering inexplicable cracks in your drinking glasses, or finding fragments of glass in your dishwasher, or cutting your hand open when reaching for a glass‚Äîbut doing it all with style‚Äîthen these glasses are for you and your family.If you‚Äôd like your drinking glasses to remain in one unbroken piece longer than three months, washing the clear plastic cups from Costco will be a wiser use of your money."

You go to take a nice refreshing drink. You lift the glass but the bottom doesn't come with it. The end result? No refreshing drink because it's now in your lap. So the first time it happened, I blamed myself for being careless. Every subsequent time, I became and currently am convinced that this a problem in their manufacture. That said, They're reasonably priced and they look nice. Buyer beware"

Chris,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021",1.0 out of 5 stars,Mikasa no longer makes quality old fashioned glass....Thin and fragile; Spend your money elsewhere!,"We have a set of 4 of these same Mikasa old fashioned glasses that we bought 8 or 10 years ago. We liked them so much that we wanted to purchase another set to bring our total to 8. They cost a bit more than your average old fashioned glass, but that would be ok if they were the same quality that Mikasa had previously produced. These new glasses are basic and not worth the 40$ price tag they came with.You can purchase similar quality glassware that is much cheaper from other companies.We have had our original set for years, and they are in great shape. This new set from Mikasa is thin and fragile. Two of the glasses already broke within the first week of use. One broke when accidentally bumped by a crystal wine glass, and the other in the sink while being washed by hand.The photo provided shows the quality that Mikasa previously produced (on the right) and what I just received from them in this last purchase (on the left). You can clearly see that the glasses are significantly thinner and not as heavy or durable anymore.* I always wash our glasses by hand, but it should be noted that Mikasa also posts contradictory statements on their Amazon page about these glasses being ""dishwasher safe"", while also stating that they should be hand washed.I would not spend money on these ever again, let alone put them in the dishwasher."

One night I opened my bar to get a glass out and noticed that one of the glasses had cracked all the way around. We threw it away, assuming it was a freak accident. A week later, the same thing happened to another one of the glasses. We're throwing away the other two for fear that it could happen while someone is drinking out of the glass.

One glass cracked after ice was added. It seems that glassware that survives the first few uses will be ok, but the need to replace nearly half of the glassware immediately adds to an already high cost. Initial contact with Mikasa customer service seemed promising, in the six months since then, however, they have been unresponsive to other inquiries. I strongly recommend avoiding this glassware, and based on a very poor experience with their customer service, I would think twice about buying any Mikasa products."

I cannot honestly believe that Mikasa made such a horrible product, they should be embarrassed and recall them all! DO NOT buy these glasses, you will be wasting a ton of money and will just be throwing them away soon after from chipping anyway.

These are not the same glasses.  They may look the same in the picture, but the difference in quality is astounding.  The old glasses have thick, heavy bases and a substantial feel to them.  The replacements I ordered from amazon are just cheap - the glass is lighter at the bottom and very thin at the top, and the etching quality is nowhere near the same.  I was going to write and complain already, but then tonight, on the first use of one of the glasses, my husband put ice in it and it broke just from that.  As I pulled a second one out of the dishwasher to put it away, it was already broken.  So two of the four glasses have not even made it through one single use.  Unacceptable.

So they are thin, flimsy, they won‚Äôt last beyond one or two, maybe three uses. The clicking function is useless. And you can‚Äôt put them in the dishwasher. I will use them for my party because they are here now and I don‚Äôt have the time and energy to shop around for anything else, but really ‚Äì find plastic ones that are sturdy enough to put in the dishwasher.

It wasn't like they were thrown to the ground- these were instances where my fingers nudged the top half of the glass just enough for it to tip over.

I think I'm going to throw away the rest of them so I can avoid having to clean up broken glass later, because I know it's just a matter of time. Wish I could give this zero stars."

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars,THESE ARE TRASH. Incredibly poor quality management,"40% of the 16pc set have a slanted bottom, and one has two sharp points on the lip of the glass. The other glasses are of mildly acceptable quality with a light tan tint.Update. We received a replacement set of glasses. The quality of these glasses are even worse, all of them have a sloped bottom and have a red tan tint.Only acceptable places for these glasses to be are a college dorm, goodwill or the trash."
Katherine Kells,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars,Very fragile.,"I just recently used these glasses when I had a dinner here with several people and these glasses were so thin and fragile that I had to get my old set of glasses out and serve our guests with them, because no one was comfortable with these.  They break very easily and feel as though they will break in your hands.  I liked the look but did not know they were so thin or I would have returned them sooner.  I had bought for this period of time when my company was here and they all commented on them being too fragile.I would like to return these and get a thicker glass set.  I am past my date to be able to return so wish me luck to try to get Amazon to understand I did not know they were so thin.  They are not an expensive glass, but $45 usually buys a set of nice everyday glasses.  Now we use our old glasses."
SD Mom,"Reviewed in the United States on July 15, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Worst glasses, Safety hazard","I bought these glasses because of the style and because they were made by Libbey. But several weeks after we received them, I was dispensing ice into the glass, from the refrigerator and when the ice cube hit the glass, it shattered. This was a bit unnerving, but I thought it was just a one time thing. But it happened two more times, and one shattered in the dishwasher. These glasses should not be sold. Someone can easily and up cutting a finger or a hand. I hope someone who is thinking about buying these glasses reads this review and thinks twice about it, especially if you have children in the house."

Mark Fenoglio,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2023",1.0 out of 5 stars,EASILY broken,"At first, I really liked these glasses, but they simply do not last. Since I purchased them a little over a month ago, 3 of the 8 taller glasses broke. Two developed cracks, which I attributed to accidents in the dishwasher. Okay, maybe that was my fault. However, the third one broke while I was dispensing ice into it from the refrigerator. An ice cube somehow managed to completely shatter the top of the glass. That should NEVER happen. I do not like writing negative reviews, but these are glasses to avoid."

Not one single glass. There are 7 tall glasses left.We have kids, yes. No one is that violent with a glass of water. Only two or three broke from an accident. All the rest broke while gently putting away from the dishwasher or were removed from the dishwasher with cracks.I read reviews prior to purchasing and these had a high rating. I don‚Äôt mind replacing things every few years because they were used and loved and broke down but this is pretty ridiculous..I‚Äôm disappointed but hopefully this helps someone else decide if they want to purchase with a high chance of these needing to be replaced in a couple years."

A week later I was doing the dishes and I was washing the dishes and the same thing happened to me where the glass just shattered for no reason in my hand and a tall glass sliced my thumb open.  These cuts are very deep and were emergency room worthy. I have very tiny hands.  So they break very easily.  We are extremely disappointed in this glasses and had to buy a different set so no one else has this issue with them.  They are very dangerous.

There were 5 of 8 tall glasses that had a horizontal line of specks and 4 of the 8 that had a bubble in the rim. These should not be sold for $40!

Anne,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,These will break eventually with regular wear and usage,I do not usually write reviews but I am disappointed in the longevity of this item. We received a little over a year ago. We use the taller glasses regularly and out of a set of 8 only 4 remain usable. We have not dropped the glasses and either hand wash or wash in dishwasher. They all start with a chip and then progress to a crack in the glass so they have been thrown out. I do not think that there is anything that the company or Amazon will do because it is beyond the 30 day window. If I would have known that these glasses were not durable than I would have never bought. And I am aggravated with Amazon return policy

I've had a similar set of Ikea glasses that have not chipped in the dishwasher in over 5 years. I'm assuming this means that I'll have a bunch of worthless, chipped glasses on my hands in under a year. So, huge waste of money for someone on as tight a budget as I am. Am returning despite the hassle of repacking a bunch of apparently overly fragile glass. Really fun"
Backslash,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2024",1.0 out of 5 stars,Shockingly poor quality,"I bought a set that looked similar at a big box store decades ago and bought this hoping to fill in the gaps of glasses broken over the years. At first I was thrilled: design is almost a perfect match, aside from the base being inexplicably slightly thicker. Then I noticed the lip.It's impossible to see in the glamor shots, but the lips of these are...bad. Wobbly and inconsistent like the machine that made them was drunk. There's supposed to be a raised ridge around the edge, and this ridge is wildly inconsistent: sometimes full height, sometimes half, sometimes flush with the glass. The remaining glasses in the set I was trying to replace have none of these issues. I'd understand if it was one odd duck out, but ALL the new glasses have this issue. I also felt some rough spurs of glass one the rims when examining them, which...yikes. Combine this with the reports of these easily and unexpectedly breaking (I've had, and dishwashingmachine'd the old set for years without issue) and it's clear the quality control on these is garbage. May try a replacement set to see if I get lucky, but otherwise, no joy."

I could have really cut my hand badly if I didn't look inside with bright lights on before washing!!! I immediately being packing them back up and have requested my refund.  Though they feel nice in your hand, they are very thin and look fragile.  Definitely not worth the money and I will never try this brand again, ever."

I started using these in January and already 4 are broken and none of them were dropped.  If they rest against something else in the dishwasher, they crack.  This morning, one that sat all alone on the dishwasher's top rack was cracked.  Also, when you look at them on the shelf, they are crooked.  They should slightly taper in from bottom to top, but instead, one side is tapered and the other side is straight!  They look ridiculous on the table.  Lousy glasses."

Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2022",1.0 out of 5 stars,Image Misleading,"The rims of the glasses were uneven.

The bottom inside the glasses, specifically the tall ones, were slanted at a weird angle, not even like the bottom that rests on the counter. One even had a big dent in the bottom of the glass that curved inward from manufacturing flaws. Overall, these have shoddy craftsmanship and are absolutely not worth the money. Returning them ASAP"

Senor Gato,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,Quality & size issues,"Buyer beware, aside from the size issues mentioned numerous times in other reviews, it should be noted these glasses are shipped directly from Libby's distribution and are not contained in the nice branded packaging. Needless to say, they would not make that ""perfect gift""If I had to take a guess, they are product from their outlet center, addresses match and so does the quality. Many of the glasses had dings, scratches, dimples and other manufacturing defects. Nothing I would put out on a retail shelf much less buy.So if you are looking for a nice set of glasses to gift to someone... Look elsewhere, and if you are looking for TINY 3oz glasses to help you with portion control (just joking) look elsewhere too, these glasses will only help you with motivation to go to the return center."

Baso,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Measurements are wrong, in description.","Glasses are very small, silly-looking actually. They are 4x4 in size and I'd be hard-pressed to say they hold 10oz . more like 8oz. Very light weight, cheaply made. They look more like a dessert cup than anything else."

Honey ,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2020",1.0 out of 5 stars,BROKEN,I received one broken glass because the cardboard separation in the box is not tall enough.

Hoping I'll get a response soon so that I can improve this review but until then...I'm a bit disappointed."
